# Claude Design payload — post-drop reconcile, 2026-07-03 pm
_The 2026-07-03 drop (payload #11–#18) was REVIEWED against the repo. Verdict: essentially everything
landed. This file now = confirm-to-close for CD's dev-memory + the few residuals. Prior items #1–#18
are superseded by this reconcile._

## Confirm-to-close (verified LANDED in-repo — CD can clear these from its dev loop)
- #11 reference contract: all `design/NN` refs exactly 1920×1080. ✓
- #12 targeting redesign: 01+08 v2 (hotkey chips, number aim-tag stack, no boxes, pulse frames
  focus_p0–p2, red aiming cursor). ✓
- #13 merchant extents/fit + #15 button/chip content (beginBtn, pager ◀▶, HELD, LEAVE) + #14 per-core
  role chips + #16 technique-icon imageBinds + youAreHere/doomTitle homed + #17 Elf blurb. ✓
- #18 dc.html + scripts shipped (`design/dchtml/` incl. proto/ + DROP_AUDIT.md). ✓
- Older family: card/tile/ware/tech chrome parts, pip templates everywhere, equipment backdrop +
  ✕ CLOSE, citymap ex-overlays homed (castlePanel/fortRows, campaignStrip, packChips, equipmentBtn),
  z normalized to ONE paint-ordinal convention, doomEta bind-gated. ✓ (2026-07-02 payload #1–#10
  all closed by this drop except the two notes below.)

## Residuals (small)
1. **"Repo docs to update in the same PR" didn't arrive** — LAYOUT_CONTRACT/DESIGN_SPEC updates listed
   in your DROP_AUDIT §"Repo docs". The ENGINE side is folding them from DROP_AUDIT (no action needed
   if that was the intent — just don't expect a separate doc drop from us to bounce back).
2. **`reference/screens/*` never landed** — listed in DROP_AUDIT contents; not needed repo-side if
   design/*.png stay the canon; confirm it's CD-internal.
3. **`target_tag.png` deletion is being done repo-side** (both content dirs + game mgcb) per your
   "delete in repo" note — closing the loop here so it isn't re-shipped in a future drop.
4. **Technique icon coverage:** `icons/technique/` ships brace/disarm/firebolt/frenzy/shot/swing,
   but the built roster also uses **bandage, block, cleave, drain, ember, jab, lunge, stoneskin** —
   those cards fall back to the tinted glyph tile (engine keeps the tile, never a blank box).
   Ship the missing PNGs whenever convenient.
5. **resourceStrip extents:** the strip region (~197 design px) can't seat all four in-run chips
   (supplies/gold/charge/summons at the authored chip size) — the engine clips the overflowing
   chips rather than spilling into the top-bar buttons, so SUMMONS drops off on encounter. Widen
   the region or shrink the chip in a future drop.
6. **Citymap gauge internals + doom hatch still flattened:** the supplies/support panels extract as
   panel + pip list only — the design's TITLE row ("Mustered Support" serif + right-aligned "0 / 2")
   and the caption line ("Capture the 2 resource holds to muster") aren't elements, so the engine
   ships a one-text-run stopgap header in the design's casing. And `doomFill` extracted as a
   `blood→blood` "gradient" — the design's diagonal HAZARD STRIPES can't be expressed (a flat red
   draws). Give the fill a pattern token or a tileable stripe asset + imageBind next drop.
7. **Skinned-button label styling mis-extracted:** the dc.html chips (autoAttackBtn/retreatBtn/
   closeBtn/leaveBtn) author their labels as inner spans — JetBrains Mono 700 at 14 CSS px,
   ground-dark, centered — but the flattened elements carry `font: display, fontPx: 8, color: ink`.
   The engine draws skinned labels per the SOURCE styling meanwhile; extract the label spans (or
   correct the element font/px/color) next drop.
8. **Encounter extraction gaps (found by the new `tools/drop_audit.py` at drop time):** Encounter.dc.html
   binds `ShieldPool.count` (the "n/m" text inside the heroShield header) and `ShieldPool.regenPct`
   (the fill inside heroShieldRegen) on anonymous spans, but neither datum reached layout.json —
   the manifest carries only `ShieldPool` / `ShieldPool.points` / `ShieldPool.regen`. The engine
   already renders both live (SHIELD n/m header + regen fill), so this is manifest-completeness
   only: next drop, extract those two spans as bound elements/parts.

## ADDENDUM (2026-07-03 late — found AFTER the send, during Doug's live-vs-design/05 review)
A1. **roleChip is bindless** — layout.json carries one `"sample": "STARTER"` and BULWARK/CASTER/
    SPECIALIST appear NOWHERE in the manifest (the PNG shows them; the datum didn't extract).
    Bind the chip label (`core.badge`); the engine will add the display datum.
A2. **State-dependent labels only extracted their CHOSEN state:** NewGame's selLabel is computed
    ('✓ CORE SET' / 'SELECT' / 'LOCKED') and the race chip ('✓ CHOSEN' / 'CHOOSE') likewise — the
    manifest carries only the chosen samples, so unchosen cards render NO button/chip live. Ship
    them as `states` with per-state labels (the button-skin `states` pattern already in the schema).
A3. **Tile VALUE+LABEL flattening (again, this drop):** loadout tiles extracted as ONE text
    ("20 RUNE BUDGET") though the source authors value + label as separate spans (mono, different
    px, +4px margin). Same for core-card BUDGET/ACTIONS/BAYS and race stat boxes (labels clip under
    values live). Please extract value/label as TWO parts with their real fonts/px/margins.
    SYSTEMIC SUGGESTION: give meaningful inner spans a `data-part` name in dc.html — then both the
    extractor AND our `tools/drop_audit.py` can track span-level fidelity (today the audit catches
    missing elements/binds, but span-flattening is invisible to it).
A4. **previewFigure backdrop:** design/05 shows the purple night panel behind the loadout figure —
    verify it extracted as a fill/part (live draws none; may be engine-side, investigating).
(NOT a CD item, for the record: race-card head sprites exist and are bound — an engine resolve gap
we're fixing; ignore any earlier "Needs-CD head sprites" phrasing if it reached you.)

## FYI locks from Doug (2026-07-03 pm) — already folded into DESIGN_SPEC
- Core Effect roster from design/05 v2 ADOPTED AS CANON (incl. Called Shot rename); mechanics get a
  dedicated effect-model pass later.
- design/05 v2 STAT BLOCKS **not** adopted — Doug wants a live tuning session first; if a future 05
  re-render can read stats from a handed sample set, ask him for the tuned numbers then.
- Merchant receiving locked: click-to-buy tiles for ALL ware categories; purchases land in inventory
  (technique→palette, minion→minion inventory, rune→rune bag); slotting stays on Equipment.
- §13 aspect-fill is being built engine-side (letterbox dies).
