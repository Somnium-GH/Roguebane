# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-12 (pass 13: retreat progress-to-available + core-kits round-trip prep)

**Pass 13 delta (2026-07-12 payload, late — the two actionable items; B2-GO / B20 were already
delivered in pass 12's drop and await your smoke probes, B22 stays deferred per the payload):**

- **CityMap Retreat/Redeploy — progress-to-available UX (NEW payload item).** Treatment chosen:
  a **fill-bar sweep across the button** in the game's established charge grammar (the techCard /
  heroShieldRegen track+fill), not a radial or numeric countdown — no text noise, instantly reads as
  "charging". `retreatBtn` gains a third authored state **`charging`** (`button_disabled` skin +
  `mutedDim` label) and nested **`retreatProgress`** track + **`retreatProgressFill`** fill (amber,
  parent-relative children). Fill binds **`nav.retreatPct`** — feed the 0..1 fraction there; the track
  binds the same key as its visibility gate, so once retreat is available the engine resolves nothing
  and the sweep unmounts. See **CD_STATUS #43** (engine half: timer feed + state pick; #39 updated —
  the retreat timer is no longer "undecided"). ⚠ The 03-citymap ref's retreatBtn sample deliberately
  switched REDEPLOY → CHARGING at 62% (the arrival-truth state, and the state that needed pixel
  proof); redeploy remains fully specified in `states` and in the pass-11/12 refs (git history).
- **core-kits.js — the 2026-07-12 Cowork hand-patch is ADOPTED verbatim** (diffed against the live
  repo copy, per the payload's don't-revert warning): Adept staff → **STR-gated** + **Jab** as 4th
  technique; Summoner **Wooden Shield replaces the Charm**, **techCap 3→4**, techniques → Ember /
  **Blast** (new `T.blast` def, wand INT attack) / Sacrifice / **Brace**; header kit comments follow.
  Our next drop therefore no longer reverts their patch.
- **`aimed_shot` key rename (payload fix):** the `T` catalog key `aimedshot` → **`aimed_shot`**
  (= Core's `Technique.Id`, so the future cores.json id lookup can't miss). Name/desc/icon unchanged —
  zero pixel change; the captured chip was already `icons/technique/aimed_shot.png`.
- **cores.json fetch switch NOT taken yet** (payload: LOCKED architecture, wait for the loader ping).
  A ⚠ PENDING SWITCH note now sits in core-kits.js' header: what moves to the fetch
  (budget/effect/gear/techniques/bayCap), what stays display-side, and that the REMAINING kit deltas in
  cores.json (slings + `shot` on grunt/warden/barbarian, reaver longsword+rapier, ranger
  axe+shield+brace, remaining techCap 4s) land WITH the switch, not before. RACES blurb/tag drift vs
  Race.cs canon: left as-is per payload (resolves at the switch).
- **⚠ State-exercise FLAG (Doug call wanted):** with the patched kit the Summoner's Skeleton no longer
  starves in its scenario (the shield freed an INT pip) — it renders **ACTIVE**, so the minion **IDLE**
  state has lost its ref exemplar; likewise Adept's Stoneskin no longer collapses (staff moved off INT).
  Adopted verbatim rather than re-tuning your scenario data — say the word and we deepen the Summoner
  scenario (INT −3) to re-exercise IDLE.

- **Changed files:** `CityMap.dc.html` (retreat states + sweep), `core-kits.js` (hand-patch adoption +
  rename + header note), `Content/layout.json` (re-extracted), `CD_STATUS.md` (#43 added, #39 timer
  line updated), this audit.
- **`Content/layout.json` re-extracted** — full 6-screen harness (`extract_all.html` → PNG channel →
  `extract_merge.js`, key-set guard passed): encounter:47 equipment:52 **citymap:43 (+2)** newgame:31
  campaignmap:10 merchant:30, 36 templates. Bind DELTA: **`nav.retreatPct` NEW** (on both sweep
  elements); `retreatBtn.states` gains `charging`; samples follow the patched Adept/Summoner kits
  (staff badge STR 2, Blast/Brace cards, 4/4 slotted). No keys removed.
- **Renders refreshed (6, all verified 1920×1080, tile+stitch):** `design/03-citymap.png`,
  `design/01-encounter-{adept,summoner}.png`, `design/02-equipment-{adept,summoner}.png`,
  `design/05-newgame.png` + their `reference/screens/` twins. NOT re-shot (correctly): all other
  cores/screens (kits untouched), 04/06/07/08, `00-assets-*` sheets.
- **NOT rebuilt (correctly):** `asset-manifest.js` + `Content.mgcb` — zero PNG adds/removes this pass
  (3155, in sync).
- **Manual design edits (Doug/user) since pass 12:** none in the editor; the Cowork core-kits
  hand-patch (engine-side, 2026-07-12) is recorded + adopted above.

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-12 (pass 12: playtest fixes B32/B33/B34 + contextual backdrops + barbarian rune + B2-GO rides)

**Pass 12 delta (2026-07-12 payload, evening — Doug playtest bugs + "sense of journey" backdrops):**

- **B33 — `resourceItem` value slot reworked for `"current/max"`.** Root cause confirmed as authored:
  the value rect `[14,1,4,9]` was measured off the bare-digit sample `"6"`. The chip is re-authored on
  all FIVE screens (one shared template): fixed **124px** chip (design 62), value = a FIXED **44px**
  band (design rect now `[14,1,22,9]` — fits 5-char `"10/12"` at mono fontPx 7), label starts clear of
  it at x39. Samples now exercise the real engine format (`6/8` supplies · `128` gold · `3/5` charge ·
  `2/2` summons), so extraction can never re-shrink the slot. Strip size grew `[188,11]→[263,11]`
  (TopRight-anchored; header seats all 4 chips + buttons on every screen — verified in the refs).
- **B34 — `combatMinionCard` name/description overlap fixed.** Root cause: grunt (the extraction-default
  core) has NO filled minions, so the template measured from an EMPTY card — the name row collapsed and
  the header divider shrank to y27, putting `minion.description`'s top inside the live name's glyph
  band. Fix = state-independent geometry: the name row carries `min-height:22px` (same guard added to
  the techCard name row), so empty + filled cards share FILLED geometry. Extracted result: header
  `[1,1,76,37]`, description `[1,38,76,97]` — exactly the sibling Equipment `minionCard`'s vertical
  layout. Also swept the B19 leftover: the empty card's sample is now **"open slot"** (was "open bay"),
  and the summoner blurb's "open bays" → "open minion slots" (`core-kits.js`).
- **B32 — preview pips now stretch-to-fill (engine parity).** Equipment `attrPip` dropped its
  `max-width:106px` per-pip cap — a 4-cap and an 8-cap row now span the SAME row width in the mockups,
  matching the shipped `ListLayout.StretchCells`. (Encounter's poolPip already stretched.) Template
  `attrPip` size re-extracted `[24,9]→[54,9]` — cosmetic; the engine stretches per live count.
- **Contextual encounter backdrops (NEW, Doug direction — first scoped set).** Eight new deterministic
  blocks in `proto/bg_gen.js` (same toolkit: dusk gradient / stars / dither / silhouettes / clean dark
  ground / vignette / scanlines): **`enc_camp`** (fire + tents + gear in the RIGHT foreground where a
  foe would stand — this REPLACES the `campMarker` icon+note treatment entirely, per Doug),
  **`enc_forest` / `enc_mountain` / `enc_river` / `enc_meadow`** (terrain — usable by ANY encounter
  type, quests included; no quest-only distinction), **`enc_quarry` / `enc_lumber`** (ResourceHold
  operations, plural per Doug's examples), **`enc_city_gates`** (the march arrives — walled city, lit
  gate, road). The Encounter backdrop element now authors `binds:"encounter.scene"` +
  `imageBind:"bg/{encounter.scene}"`; static image stays `combat_field` so an engine without the field
  draws as today. **Engine owes the per-node pick + field — see CD_STATUS #41.** A `scene` preview prop
  (field/forest/mountain/river/meadow/quarry/lumber/city_gates) exercises every variant in the one
  screen; the shell's center caption follows the arrival (— YOUR CAMP — at camp, etc.).
- **`campMarker` RETIRED (B29 re-cut).** `campMarker`/`campMarkerIcon`/`campMarkerLabel`/
  `campMarkerNote` are GONE from Encounter + `layout.json` — a Camp arrival is the `enc_camp` backdrop
  + `CAMP` label + foeless action bar, no floating icon. CD_STATUS #39 rewritten: CD's manifest half is
  DELIVERED; the engine-side foeless-tick (Core state + Game render for Camp/Quest/nothing-here)
  remains the supervised/large item, as flagged in the loop note.
- **Barbarian core-rune icon shipped:** `icons/rune/core_barbarian.png` (365×365, decagon in the
  `#cf7a44` accent + carved ⚒, transparent corners) — captured from the live NewGame card via
  `rune_capture.js` (dual-bg recovery), completing the 7-core token set. Engine-blit only (screens draw
  the inline SVG) → no render owed to it beyond this pass's refresh.
- **B2-GO rides this drop (inventory for your smoke probes).** Already built + manifest-synced:
  **36 melee weapon PNGs** (`{longsword,axe,mace,claymore,battleaxe,warhammer,dagger,rapier,shortsword}_
  {iron,steel,mithral,dwarven}`), **sling/staff/charm/tome/wand ×4 tiers each**, **8 ranged back-mounts**
  (`bow_*_back` + `sling_*_back`), worn tree under `sprites/gear/worn/{human,elf,dwarf,halfling,
  half_giant}/`, **41 figures** in `layout.json.figures` (all with `sockets.back`; elf_ranger neckline
  fix in), `worn` inventory block, `gear_catalog.json` rows. Binding-spec gap G1 (the `back` socket
  is absent from LAYOUT_CONTRACT §1/§2) still rides CD_STATUS #32 — spec sync, not art.
- **B20 status:** the design-side remainder was already in (5×7 NewGame, statBonus chips, rules-text
  action cards, "minions" vocabulary) — this pass re-extracts + re-renders the refs against it, incl.
  `05-newgame.png` (5 races × 3-page core pager) and the full per-core 01/02 sets.

- **Merchant BUY/SELL mode + attribute badges (same-day follow-up, Doug).** (a) `modeToggle` +
  `modeBuyBtn`/`modeSellBtn` on the Wares header; SELL = **Your Goods** (grunt kit + finds + rune bag,
  real items) — equipped/slotted pieces dimmed with an `EQUIPPED` chip, sellable rows `SELL` + `+Ng`;
  new ref **`design/07-merchant-sell.png`** (+ reference mirror). `waresTitle` now bound
  (`merchant.mode.title`). (b) `wareCard`'s ARM/WPN/TEC kind boxes RETIRED → the invCard **attribute
  badge** (`ware.badge`/`ware.attr`/`ware.cost` + `colorBind ware.attrColor` replace
  `ware.category`/`ware.categoryColor`); runes badge = affected attr + budget points. (c) TECHNIQUES
  carry no badge (redundant with the glyph chip's attr fill) — glyph chip + colored `"DEX 1"` tag,
  the action-bar grammar. (d) technique stock rule: **always 3 or 6** — the wares list is a 3-col
  GRID (a 6-stock = two rows of 3) and the pager packs whole sections by HEIGHT, so a section never
  splits across pages (card width stays 258px). All samples re-sourced to the REAL catalog (`core-kits.js` now exports
  `TECHS`/`MINIONS`; Merchant imports it — Quilted Jack / Ashwood Bow / Bound Wisp etc. sample
  inventions are GONE). See **CD_STATUS #42** for the engine half (mode state, sell feed,
  badge-suppression on technique wares).

- **Changed files:** `Encounter.dc.html` (B33/B34 + scene bind + campMarker removal + zoneCaption),
  `Merchant.dc.html` (BUY/SELL mode + badges + 3-col grid wares),
  `Equipment.dc.html` (B32/B33), `CityMap.dc.html` / `Merchant.dc.html` / `CampaignMap.dc.html` (B33),
  `core-kits.js` (B19 blurb sweep + `TECHS`/`MINIONS` exports), `proto/bg_gen.js` (+8 scene blocks + conifers/ridge/ground/tent
  helpers), `Content/ASSET_MANIFEST.md`, `CD_STATUS.md` (#41 added; #39 rewritten; #40 unchanged).
- **Assets added (9):** `bg/enc_{camp,forest,mountain,river,meadow,quarry,lumber,city_gates}.png` +
  `icons/rune/core_barbarian.png`. `asset-manifest.js` + `Content.mgcb` REBUILT from disk (full
  walkers, multi-asset pass): **3146 → 3155**, in sync. **No removals.**
- **`Content/layout.json` re-extracted** — full 6-screen harness (`extract_all.html` → PNG channel →
  `extract_merge.js`, key-set guard passed): encounter:47 equipment:52 citymap:41 newgame:31
  campaignmap:10 merchant:30 elements, 36 templates. Bind DELTA: `encounter.scene` now carries
  `imageBind:"bg/{encounter.scene}"`; `campMarker*` element ids REMOVED; Merchant gains
  `modeToggle`/`modeBuyBtn`/`modeSellBtn` (+ per-state `asset`) and bound `waresTitle`; `wareCard`
  parts `ware.badge`/`ware.attr`/`ware.cost`/`ware.attrColor` REPLACE `ware.category`/
  `ware.categoryColor`; no other bind keys changed.
- **Refs re-rendered (all confirmed 1920×1080, tile+stitch pipeline):** `01-encounter-{grunt,warden,
  adept,summoner,reaver,ranger,barbarian,quest,camp}.png`, `02-equipment-{grunt,warden,adept,summoner,
  reaver,ranger,barbarian}.png`, `03-citymap.png`, `04-campaignmap.png`, `05-newgame.png`,
  `07-merchant.png`, `07-merchant-sell.png` (NEW) (+ all `reference/screens/` mirrors),
  `00-assets-3-ui.png` (sheet regen — new
  backdrops + 7th rune token). 06-style-frame / 08-reticle-mounts unchanged — untouched.
- **Manual design edits (Doug/user) since pass 11:** none reported or observed.

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-12 (pass 11: payload-B sweep — B18/B20/B22/B26/B27/B29/B30/B31 + doc closes)

**Pass 11 delta (the 2026-07-12 payload, B28 already closed by Doug):**

- **B30 — both technique bars now seat their 4th card.** Root cause matched your analysis: flex items
  round UP on extraction while regions round down. Fixed with the proven B23/B24/B25 idiom (cap the
  ITEM, don't fight flex rounding): Encounter `techCard` capped `max-width:206px` → item **103**,
  `4×103+3×6=430 ≤ 433`; Equipment `loadoutCard` capped `max-width:296px` → item **148**,
  `4×148+3×6=610 ≤ 613` (3px slack each). Side benefit: every core now shares ONE card width —
  matching the single template size the engine stamps (the design's 3-slot cores used to draw wider
  cards than the engine ever could).
- **B31 — Encounter `poolRows` grown for the CON row.** `min-height:164px` → emitted size **[309,82]**
  (needed ≥78; 4px slack). Zero visual shift — rows were already painted, only the region grew.
- **B27 — minion-column reflow is now DECLARATIVE: new `countWidth` manifest field** (our call between
  your (a)/(b): a formula field, not per-cap thresholds). Equipment `minionColumn` + Encounter
  `minionGroup` emit `countWidth:{bind,item:78,gap:6,pad:8,hideAtZero:true}` (binds `minions.cap` /
  `loadout.minionCap`) — width = count×item+(count−1)×gap+pad, hidden at 0. See **CD_STATUS #38**.
- **B29 — Encounter shell hosts foeless arrivals + CityMap retreat/redeploy.** New `arrival` state on
  the shell: `questPanel` (frame-card prompt: kicker/title/prompt + gold ACCEPT / neutral DECLINE,
  gated on `encounter.quest`; copy = bound SAMPLES, quest catalog stays Doug's pass), `campMarker`
  (camp icon + note; Camp = foeless pre-activation — TARGETING relaxes to READY foeless, HELD/CHARGING
  keep reserving), and "nothing here" = the bare shell (NO new elements needed). Foe cluster is
  sc-if'd — engine unmounts it on unresolved `encounter.foe`. CityMap gains `retreatBtn` with states
  `retreat` / `redeploy` (gold `button_on` skin + relabel; states carry NEW `label`+`asset` fields).
  Two new refs: **`design/01-encounter-quest.png` + `01-encounter-camp.png`** (+ reference/screens
  copies) — mutually-exclusive whole-screen states, same rule as the cores. See **CD_STATUS #39**.
  The DEX-gated retreat timer was NOT designed against (per your "undecided" flag).
- **B20 — coreCard accent contrast (Doug #7) + accent tokens published.** New extractor support
  `data-color-bind-target="border"` → the accent bind emits INSIDE the border spec
  (`border.colorBind`), never a full-rect fill; applied to the NewGame coreCard effect block,
  `previewCoreEffect`, AND Equipment's `coreEffectBlock` (was a static token — same bug class).
  **`style.coreAccents`** now published (style_tokens.js → layout.json.style, all 7 cores) — read it
  instead of the stopgap palette. See **CD_STATUS #40**. Core-Effect copy resynced to
  `design/systems/CORE_RUNES.md`: **Barbarian "Warlord's Might" corrected** (claymore −3 AND STR plate
  −1/piece; claymore base cost 5 → kit demand STR 10, Half-Giant's exact fit) and **Reaver carries
  Bandage** (Frenzy, Flurry, Bandage — "no heal" framing retired). `core-kits.js` resolver + kits
  updated; NewGame kit lines follow automatically.
- **B22 — SALE card grammar proposed on `wareCard`:** a gold-trimmed **price-counter footer strip**
  (named part `priceStrip`: BUY/SHORT-OF-COIN chip + spoils coin + price) — the "for sale" signature an
  `invCard` never has. Per-kind chip ART (technique glyph / rune polygon on the sale face) deliberately
  waits for the real sale catalog (sample names don't all map to captured glyph ids).
- **B18 — the last open icons shipped:** `icons/technique/{parry,steel,suture}` (capture pipeline,
  `atom_slice.js` `RB_TECHS_T2`: parry ❰ DEX-green; steel ◆ / suture ✛ CON-gold — T2 kin of Brace ◈ /
  Bandage ✚) + `icons/minion/{golem,hound}` (`ui_atoms_gen.js`, same flat-pictogram register as the
  skull; generator gained `only`/`outDirs` args). Defs for Parry/Steel/Suture added to `core-kits.js`
  `T` (copy from TECHNIQUES.md/RULES_SNAPSHOT) — not slotted in any sample kit. **Engine-blit only →
  no render owed to these.**
- **B26 — CD_STATUS #34 armor wording eradicated/corrected:** armor CONSUMES POOL (standing
  reservation, same as weapons/techniques) — the "threshold-gated only" sub-entry was wrong and is
  gone; the implementation (core-kits v6) already did this. #34 rewritten; stale sub-items (mount
  reconcile, glyph capture, stale-render lines) cleared. **CD_STATUS #37 (B28) deleted** — closed.
- **B8 / B11 / B1b / B21 / B2-GO — already-built confirms (riding this drop, no new work):**
  beaconNode `hover`/`current` states are authored (templates.beaconNode.states) and `glow` is spec'd
  by the LOCKED `style.pulse` block (#30 — steady 1.8s ease-in-out breathe, ring+halo numbers in the
  block; build that one primitive and wire cityNode+beaconNode to it). Bow sprites
  `bow_{short,long,compound,elven}` (+ `*_back`) and their `gear_catalog.json` rows exist (B2-GO
  batch). Key-set diff guard runs in `extract_merge.js` on every merge (B1b — this pass's merge ran
  it). The no-absolute-positioning rule is permanent in CLAUDE.md + LAYOUT_CONTRACT §3 (B21).
- **CityMap sample fixes:** PACK chips now sample the grunt kit (`Iron Longsword`/`Wooden Shield`/
  `Iron Greaves`, greaves correctly STR — old `Sword`/`Round Shield` were pre-catalog vestiges).

- **Changed files:** `Encounter.dc.html`, `Equipment.dc.html`, `NewGame.dc.html`, `CityMap.dc.html`,
  `Merchant.dc.html`, `core-kits.js`, `style_tokens.js`, `proto/screen_extract.js` (color-bind-target +
  count-width + coreAccents in RB_styleBlock), `proto/atom_slice.js` (`RB_TECHS_T2`),
  `proto/ui_atoms_gen.js` (golem/hound + only/outDirs), `proto/ref_stitch.js` (`skip` arg for
  prep-step tile runs), `Content/ASSET_MANIFEST.md`, `CD_STATUS.md`.
- **Assets added (5):** `icons/technique/{parry,steel,suture}.png`, `icons/minion/{golem,hound}.png` —
  `asset-manifest.js` + `Content.mgcb` appended via `RB_addAssets`: **3141 → 3146**, in sync. No
  removals.
- **`Content/layout.json` re-extracted** — full 6-screen harness run (`extract_all.html` →
  `extract_merge.js`, key-set guard PASSED; elements: encounter 51 · equipment 52 · citymap 41 ·
  newgame 31 · campaignmap 10 · merchant 27; 36 templates). Verified in the merged manifest:
  `techList` item [103,136] · `loadoutList` item [148,89] · `poolRows` [309,82] · `countWidth` on both
  minion groups · `border.colorBind` on all three effect blocks · `retreatBtn` states ·
  `style.coreAccents` · `wareCard` `priceStrip`.
- **Renders refreshed (19, all verified 1920×1080):** `design/01-encounter-{grunt,warden,adept,
  summoner,reaver,ranger,barbarian,quest,camp}.png` ×9, `design/02-equipment-<core>.png` ×7,
  `design/03-citymap.png`, `design/05-newgame.png`, `design/07-merchant.png` + all
  `reference/screens/*` twins. NOT re-shot: `04-campaignmap` (untouched), `06-style`, `08-reticle`,
  `00-assets-*` sheets (no sprite/world-art change; the 5 new icons are engine-blit chips).
- **Self-check:** `proto/resolve_check.html` re-composed encounter+equipment at 2560×1440 / 2560×1080 /
  1440×1080 — zero drift/detachment of the new elements; the full-bleed-bar overhang at off-aspect is
  the known engine aspect-fill axis (#35), unchanged.
- **New CD_STATUS entries riding this drop:** **#38** `countWidth` · **#39** foeless arrivals + state
  `label`/`asset` fields · **#40** `border.colorBind` + `style.coreAccents`.
- **Manual design edits (Doug/user) since pass 10:** none (B28 closure was engine-side confirm).

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-06 (pass 10: payload B geometry fixes + minion vocab rename + confirm-to-close)

**Pass 10 delta (payload B-series, SOURCE-DRIVEN per Doug "do it from dc.html" — no asset churn):**
All geometry was authored in the `.dc.html` sources and re-extracted through the real pipeline
(`proto/extract_all.html` → `extract_merge.js`); numbers below read off the merged `layout.json`.

- **B24 — Equipment GEAR tab now seats 2 columns.** `invItems` grid columns pinned `402px 402px`
  (was `1fr 1fr`, which rounded each card UP to exactly ½ the container and overshot by 1px → the
  engine's honest GridCapacity under-seated to 1 col). Emits `invItems.size [411,183]`, item `[201,44]`
  → `201×2+6 = 408 ≤ 411` (3px slack) → engine seats 2. Widened via the inventory content-wrapper
  padding `16→8`.
- **B25 — Attributes panel now renders the 6th (free) pip.** `attrs.cells` strip widened to design
  rect width **332** (was 326; needed ≥328) by trimming the `attrBar` row gap `11→8`, AND `attrPip`
  capped `max-width:106px` so a 6-pip sample extracts `pipW=53` (not 54) instead of flexing up with the
  container. `6×53+5×2 = 328 ≤ 332` → engine capacity **6**. High pools (e.g. Reaver DEX 10) still flex
  below the cap → no overflow (verified in `02-equipment-reaver.png`).
- **B23 — Inventory tabs fill the row; long labels stop shrinking.** `invTab` fixed `width:262px`
  (design 131) `text-align:center` (was `padding:8px 22px`, ~40px content-width leaving ~290px dead
  space). 3 tabs `3×131+2×4 = 401 ≤ 403` usable → all seat at full size; "TECHNIQUES"/"MINIONS" no
  longer force `TextPxWrapped` to shrink. (Fixed width, not `flex:1`, to dodge the same 1px round-up
  under-seat as B24.)
- **B19 — "bay" vocabulary eradicated; "minion" only.** Encounter + NewGame renamed (Equipment already
  carried no "bay" term). Encounter: template `minionBay`→**`combatMinionCard`**, element ids
  `bayGroupLabel`→`minionGroupLabel` / `bayList`→`minionList`, container bind `loadout.bays`→
  `loadout.minions`, item binds `bay.{icon,hotkey,state,name,cost,gateColor,description}`→`minion.*`.
  NewGame: `core.bays`→`core.minionCap`, `preview.bays`→`preview.minionCap`, part `baysBox`→`minionsBox`.
  Retired `templates.minionBay` deleted from `layout.json` (intentional-removal, so the key-set guard
  passed). **Verified: zero `bay.*` / `loadout.bays` / `core.bays` / `preview.bays` / `minionBay` /
  `bayList` / `bayGroupLabel` / `baysBox` remain anywhere in the manifest.**
  - ⚠ **DEVIATION from B19's literal `minionCard`:** Equipment ALREADY owns the global template name
    `minionCard` (its build minion card — no combat state chip), and template names are a flat global
    namespace in the extractor, so renaming Encounter's `minionBay`→`minionCard` would COLLIDE (the
    later-extracted Equipment card silently overwrites Encounter's, dropping its combat `state` chip).
    Encounter's combat card is therefore **`combatMinionCard`**; Equipment's stays `minionCard`
    (untouched). Flag if you'd rather unify the two into one template.
  - **FYI (not touched):** Equipment's minion item-binds are plural (`minions.*`); Encounter's are now
    singular (`minion.*`, matching its own `technique.*` item convention). B19 targeted only "bay"
    terms, so Equipment was left as-is; the plural/singular split is a minor future-consistency nit.
- **B7 — raceCard head no longer stretches (confirm-to-close).** The source was already corrected in a
  prior pass (one bound `<img height:70 width:auto>` with `data-shadow` + `race.headImage` +
  `sprites/body/{race.id}_grunt/head_healthy`, on its own square element, background panel a plain
  gradient). This pass RE-EXTRACTED so `layout.json`'s `raceCard` now carries the head imageBind on the
  **square rect `[10,22,35,35]`** (aspect 1.0, shadowed) — the portrait-aspect background panel is gone.
- **B4 — confirm-to-close, no change.** `nav.equipment` button already authored on Encounter (DISABLED
  in combat) and CampaignMap (both carry a "payload B4" comment). Nothing owed.
- **B10 — confirm-to-close, no change.** DEX/INT ladder names are already §6c-canon in
  `design/dchtml/gear_catalog.json` (Leather Cap→Hardened Cap→Studded Cap→Reinforced Hood; Cloth Cap→
  Silk Hood→Ornate Circlet→Humming Circlet; Padded→Leather→Studded→Reinforced Leather) and in
  `roster_gen.js`'s per-tier `names[]` arrays; `layout.json` carries no gear `name` fields. No
  "Leather Leather …" drift anywhere.

- **Changed files:** `Encounter.dc.html` (B19), `Equipment.dc.html` (B23/B24/B25), `NewGame.dc.html`
  (B19) + their `drop/design/dchtml/` mirrors; `Content/layout.json` re-extracted (all 6 screens,
  guard passed); `design/02-equipment-<core>.png` ×7 + `reference/screens/equipment-<core>.png` ×7
  re-stitched (all verified EXACTLY 1920×1080). `CD_STATUS.md` #31 removed (resolved). No removals of
  shipped assets.
- **NOT rebuilt (correctly):** `asset-manifest.js` + `Content.mgcb` — **no `Content/**/*.png` add or
  remove this pass** (only `Content/layout.json` changed in the package). No re-render of
  `01-encounter-*` (B19 is an attribute rename → zero pixel change) or `05-newgame` (rename-only +
  B7 already reflected in the current source render).
- **CD_STATUS #31 CLOSED (removed):** Equipment inventory card states (`invCard`/`loadoutCard`/`invTab`
  families) were previously hand-mirrored into `layout.json`; this pass they are genuinely produced by
  `proto/extract_all.html` → `extract_merge.js` (clean merge, guard passed), so the "re-extract to
  confirm the hand-patch" condition is met.
- **Engine follow-up (OURS, per B19):** the renderer's bind-key literals update in lockstep now this
  drop lands — new keys: `combatMinionCard`, `minion.{icon,hotkey,state,name,cost,gateColor,description}`,
  `loadout.minions`, `core.minionCap`, `preview.minionCap`, `minionsBox`.
- **Manual design edits (Doug/user) since pass 9:** none.

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-05 (pass 9: dual-attr Frenzy/Flurry + split glyph capture)

**Pass 9 delta (dual-attribute techniques, Doug — SOURCE ONLY, no asset churn):**
- **Frenzy + Flurry are now payable in STR *or* DEX.** `core-kits.js` technique defs gain
  `either: ['STR','DEX']` (order = STR-top / DEX-bottom). The `resolve()` technique pass picks the pool
  that can afford it (else the one with the most free room, for the lock shortfall), reserves there, and
  returns `payAttr` per technique. New shared helpers: `glyphFill(t)` (solid stat colour, OR a hard 50/50
  top/bottom split for `either` — NO black seam, Doug: it interfered with the glyph), `costSplit(t)`
  (two `{attr,cost,color}` rows), `costLabel` → `"STR/DEX N"`. Rendered on THREE surfaces: the technique
  glyph chip (split fill) + a two-row STR-red/DEX-green cost readout on the **Encounter** action-bar card,
  the **Equipment** loadout card, and the **Equipment** inventory badge (split box). Verified on the
  Reaver core (Finesse −1 → effective 2/2 Frenzy, 1/1 Flurry).
- **Split glyph PNGs re-captured** — `Content/icons/technique/{frenzy,flurry}.png` (+ drop copies)
  re-shot with the 50/50 STR-red/DEX-green split fill via the established capture pipeline
  (`proto/atom_capture.js` `RB_buildChipOverlay` gradient chips → `proto/atom_slice.js`
  `RB_buildTechChips` with new `RB_TECHS_SPLIT` + array-`glyphBg` split support; glyph SHAPE still lifted
  from the live-font capture, keyed against the darker half so both bg halves zero out). Same 120×120
  dims + same paths → **`asset-manifest.js`, `Content.mgcb`, `layout.json` UNCHANGED** (overwrite only, no
  new/removed entries). Now visible in `Asset Review.dc.html`.
- **NO screen-render churn.** Technique glyph PNGs are ENGINE-BLIT ONLY — the screens draw the design-font
  glyph — so no `design/0N-*.png` was re-shot for the glyph capture (ASSET_GEN_METHOD "engine-only asset
  needs no re-render"). The Reaver `design/01-encounter-reaver.png` / `02-equipment-reaver.png` are still
  behind the SOURCE by the live split treatment (glyph chip + two-row cost the SCREENS draw) — refresh
  those two when a screen-render pass runs; the glyph-PNG capture does not gate it.
- **Changed files:** `design/dchtml/{core-kits.js, Encounter.dc.html, Equipment.dc.html}` +
  `design/dchtml/proto/atom_slice.js` (split-chip generator) in the drop; `Content/icons/technique/
  {frenzy,flurry}.png` (+ drop copies) re-captured. ⚠ **`core-kits.js` was MISSING from the drop
  entirely** (both dchtml mirrors) despite the screens importing it — ADDED this pass so the drop is
  reproducible. No removals, no manifest/mgcb changes.
- **Engine follow-ups:** see **CD_STATUS #36** — dual-attr `either` cost still owes the `layout.json`
  manifest field + the runtime which-pool reserve decision + the two-row split-cost draw. The split glyph
  PNGs shipped this pass, so only the field + cost-draw remain. (Not restated here — CD_STATUS is canon.)
- **Drop reconciliation (surgical parity sweep, this pass):** the drop had drifted well beyond the
  session's own edits — brought fully back in sync WITHOUT a full re-stage: added the entirely-missing
  **`ui/` group** (32 assets: pips/buttons/frames) to `drop/Roguebane.Content/`; synced stale
  `layout.json` (root re-extraction, +5.5KB — the `parent`/anchor work never dropped); synced the whole
  **`proto/`** (26 files were missing incl. `asset_incremental.js`, `resolve_check.html`, `screen_perms.js`;
  9 stale generators); synced 6 stale dchtml sources (`CityMap, CampaignMap, NewGame, Merchant, Figure,
  style_tokens.js`) + added `Core Loadouts.dc.html` + `Inventory Tabs.dc.html`. Verified parity: Content
  3141/3141 (bg5+icons49+sprites3055+ui32), `Content.mgcb` + `ASSET_MANIFEST.md` + all 24 `design/*.png`
  IDENTICAL, all 17 dchtml sources in sync. (Empty `Canvas.dc.html` scaffold intentionally excluded.)
- **Artifact rename (going forward):** `CD_STATUS_MEMORY.md` → **`CD_STATUS.md`**; it now ships in every
  drop (`drop/design/dchtml/`) alongside this audit, and the two are deduplicated — CD_STATUS holds the
  canonical open-gap prose, the audit references `CD_STATUS #N`.
- **Manual design edits (Doug/user) since pass 8:** the dual-attr direction itself (STR-top/DEX-bottom,
  "let the colours meet — drop the black seam, it interferes with glyphs").

---

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-05 (pass 8: v6 technique glyphs captured — incremental)

**Pass 8 delta (technique-glyph capture, incremental fast path):**
- **6 v6 technique glyphs captured** — `icons/technique/{siphon, sacrifice, barkskin, flurry, aimed_shot,
  bind}` (120×120 chips, glyph shape from the design-font render, glyphBg = core-kits `T` attr colour;
  siphon/barkskin INT, flurry/aimed_shot DEX, bind STR, sacrifice minion-cost grey). Closes CD_STATUS
  #34.4 / pass-7 "B18 glyph capture (incl. Bind)" for the full v6 roster. Reproducible: added to
  `proto/atom_slice.js` `RB_TECHS_V6`; captured via one overlay/screenshot batch + one `run_script`.
- **Incremental, no waste (the point of this pass):** technique glyphs are ENGINE-BLIT ONLY — the
  screens draw the design-font glyph — so **no `design/0N-*.png` render changed and none was re-shot.**
  The manifest+mgcb were APPENDED (`proto/asset_incremental.js` `RB_addAssets`, not the ~3000-file disk
  walk): **3135 → 3141 PNGs.** Chips + both manifest files were written straight into `drop/` in the
  same pass — no drop re-stage. New tooling this pass: `proto/asset_incremental.js`, `atom_slice.js`
  `RB_TECHS_V6` + `outDirs` arg; instructions in ASSET_GEN_METHOD.md "Incremental adds" + CLAUDE.md.
- **Changed files (adds only):** `Content/icons/technique/{siphon,sacrifice,barkskin,flurry,aimed_shot,
  bind}.png` (+ drop copies); `asset-manifest.js` + `Content/Content.mgcb` (+ drop copies) — 6 new
  entries. Binds unchanged (the screens already `data-image-bind` `icons/technique/{id}`; the 404s those
  6 ids threw now resolve). No removals. No manual design edits this pass.

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-05 (pass 7: Barbarian core + Half-Giant race, on top of pass 6)

**Pass 7 delta (Barbarian core + Half-Giant race, Doug 2026-07-05):**
- **Barbarian — new 7th core (B15/B16/B18).** Rune `core_barbarian` (glyph ⚒). Core Effect **Warlord's
  Might** — "Two-handed swords cost 2 less strength to equip" (resolver applies −2 to claymore equip).
  Stat bonus **+4 STR · +1 CON**. v6 kit: Iron Claymore (2H) + Iron plate ×4 · Cleave, **Bind** (new STR
  shield source — B18 icon PENDING capture, renders design-font glyph meanwhile), Bandage · **3 actions
  / 1 minion / 14 budget** (Doug). Favored worn line = STR → new **Barbarian STR worn theme** authored
  across all 5 races (savage hide-strap + tusk/fur accents). Figure = light-medium-brown hide with a
  gold-buckled lace + pale fur collar (Doug: "not the green"). Added to Encounter/Equipment `core` enum
  + NewGame grid (now 7 cores → 3 pages of 3 with the pager).
- **Half-Giant — new 5th race (B17).** STR affinity **6/4/4/4**, HP 18. First TALL body-morph: +3 torso
  rows, longer legs/arms, slightly wider + bigger head — reads clearly taller than the other races while
  **tuned to fit the fixed paper-doll frames** (native 408 vs human 360, ~13%; Doug tuned down twice so
  it doesn't overflow). Full figure/part/worn set for all 7 cores; worn race set now
  {human, elf, dwarf, halfling, half_giant}. Added to the `race` selectors.
- **"BAYS" → "MINIONS"** everywhere user-facing (NewGame core-card + Loadout labels, Equipment identity
  stat) per Doug; element ids/binds unchanged.
- **NewGame core cards** enlarged + given a **STARTING KIT** panel (weapons · armor line · skills ·
  minion from the v6 kit) so the taller card fills down to the pager; Effect + kit fonts enlarged.
- **Counts:** roster now **41 figures** (5 races × 7 cores + 6 foes); **3135 PNGs** (asset-manifest +
  Content.mgcb rebuilt from disk). layout.json re-extracted; 00-assets-1 figures sheet + roster_mockup
  (full 35 race×core grid) rebuilt.
- **Renders refreshed this pass:** `design/05-newgame.png`; `design/01-encounter-{barbarian,summoner,
  ranger}.png`; `design/02-equipment-{barbarian,summoner,ranger}.png` (the new core + the two cores whose
  minion now blits its real per-type deploy sprite). The grunt/warden/adept/reaver enc+eq renders from
  pass 6 remain accurate (no minion, core-only stat chips unchanged) — not re-shot.
- **Still OUR side:** B18 technique GLYPH capture (now also **Bind**); half-giant worn↔figure morph
  composition (§7/§17 #15). Everything else below is the pass-6 record.

# DROP AUDIT — 2026-07-05 (pass 6: two new races + v6 balance + race selectors + body-morph)

Rides with this drop to `Somnium-GH/Roguebane` (regenerated per drop). Drop contents =
`Roguebane.Content/` (from local `Content/`, repo-name mapping applied) + `design/` (1920×1080 renders
+ `design/00-assets-*` sheets; `design/dchtml/` = all `*.dc.html` + `support.js` + `style_tokens.js` +
`attribute-model.js` + **`core-kits.js`** + `asset-manifest.js` + `gear_catalog.json` + the full
`proto/` + this audit).

**Headline:** the race roster grew **2 → 4** (Dwarf + Halfling, B17) with the first real **body-morph**
(dwarf stout+short, halfling small+swift, both with wider/shorter or shorter heads); Encounter +
Equipment gained a **race selector** alongside the core selector; and every attribute / loadout /
technique / minion across NewGame, Equipment and Encounter was **resynced to the v6 balance sheet**
(the number gospel), driven by a rewritten `core-kits.js`.

## ‼ STATUS — PROTOTYPE, tuned to v6 (not silent drift)
Core Effects are the payload-B15 PROTOTYPE roster (Jack of All Trades / Fortified / Resonance /
Conscription / Finesse / Fletcher's Luck), superseding §11 canon. All numbers are the **v6 balance
sheet** (2026-07-05 session): race bases, per-core stat bonuses, reserve costs, default loadouts.

## ‼ REMOVED this pass (the delete script — a file drop can't express deletions)
1. **No assets removed.** Only ADDS (2 new races' figures/parts/worn, minion deploy sprites) + edits.
   The repo's existing `human_*`/`elf_*` figure + worn trees are unchanged in shape; the `dwarf_*` /
   `halfling_*` trees are new.
2. If the repo still carries a `Content/sprites/minion/` (singular) directory, note the deploy sprites
   ship under `sprites/minions/` (plural) — the game-side mirror should use the plural path.

## a) What changed THIS pass
- **`core-kits.js` — REWRITTEN to the v6 sheet + made race-aware.** Now the ONE source for NewGame too
  (not just Encounter/Equipment). Adds: `RACES` (Human 5/5/5/5 · Elf 4/6/4/4 · Dwarf 4/4/4/6 ·
  Halfling 4/4/6/4, v6 §B) + `raceHp` (10 + 2×CON); `CORE_BONUS` + `pools(core,race)` +
  `statBonus`/`statBonusFull` (payload B16 per-core stat bonuses); v6 **effect discounts** in the
  resolver (`gearGate`/`techCost`/`bayCost`: Grunt −1 all, Warden plate→CON −1/tier, Reaver two-weapon
  −1, Ranger bow −1/tier); the v6 default kits + demonstration scenarios; and `resolve(core, race)` /
  `poolRows(…, race)` / `inventory(…, race)` all threaded with race. **ARMOR NOW RESERVES POOL PIPS**
  (v6 §C "Requirement = armor + weapons + skills + minions") — this closes the pass-5 DROP_AUDIT Doug
  call in favor of the summed-pool reading.
- **Two new races (B17) — full figure/part/worn batch**, generated by `proto/roster_gen.js` (the
  persistent generator; golden rule). New morph axes on the `RACE` table: `short` (leg/robe-collar),
  `armD` (arm length), `headW`/`headH` (head box) — the first true body morph. Dwarf: stout (wider
  torso), short legs, head +2 wider / −1 shorter, ruddy skin + ginger hair. Halfling: elf-slim build,
  small ear points, head −1/−2, WARM skin (explicitly not elf pallor) + chestnut hair. Emitted for all
  6 cores each → `sprites/body/{dwarf,halfling}_<core>/` (parts + damage states) and the full B12
  worn-armor set → `sprites/gear/worn/{dwarf,halfling}/…` (**worn set now 1488 files across 4 races**).
- **Race selector on Encounter + Equipment** — new `race` enum prop (human/elf/dwarf/halfling) beside
  the existing `core` prop; pools, HP, figure, identity label all reflect it. NewGame's race column now
  reads its 4 races + all data from `core-kits.js` (no more local duplicated tables) and every race can
  bear every core (v6 clearance; the old Elf↛Warden hard-disallow retired).
- **HELD indicator on the Equipment demo** (Doug) — same `heldBadge` idiom as Encounter, gated on
  `combat.paused`: Equipment can be opened during combat (combat holds; loadout read-only in combat).
- **Per-core STAT-BONUS boxes (B16)** — NewGame core cards show the core's additive bonus in the EXACT
  race-card attr-box idiom (colored square / big value / little label), one box per non-zero stat
  (Grunt shows all four +1s, singles centered). Equipment identity block shows the same via compact
  chips. Loadout preview folds the bonus into the effective attr tiles (no separate badges — Doug).
- **NewGame core grid → 3-per-page pager** (Doug) — bigger single-row cards (152×324 design-space) with
  a Merchant/Equipment-style `corePager` (`button_pager.png`), 6 cores across 2 pages.
- **Per-type minion DEPLOY sprites** — `sprites/minions/{skeleton,golem,hound,imp,wisp}.png`; the
  Encounter field minion + the Encounter/Equipment bay icons now blit the real per-type sprite
  (closes the old skeleton stand-in). (B18 technique GLYPH icons are still an ASSET_GEN capture pass —
  see FYI below; the action bar renders the design-font glyph meanwhile, unchanged.)
- **`Figure.dc.html`** — figure enum extended with the new race grunts (no logic change; it already
  reads `layout.json` generically).
- **Merchant `waresShelves`** bumped to fit its 3rd row (`min-height:768px` → extractor size[1]=384,
  closing payload B13); **Equipment `buildMinions`** now sizes to the bay count (B14 closed —
  layout.json size [162,89], item [78,89]).

## b) Binds added/removed
- New engine display data the manifest now carries: `core.statBonus` (list template `statBonusChip`
  on Equipment, `statBonusBox` on NewGame), `cores.page*` (NewGame `corePager` cluster mirroring the
  Merchant/Equipment pagers), `combat.paused` on the Equipment `heldBadge`, and the `race` selector is
  a screen prop (no new bind — the engine supplies the chosen race like it does core). Encounter/
  Equipment figure + minion image binds now resolve per race/type.
- `Content/layout.json` **re-extracted** (`proto/extract_all.html` → `extract_merge.js`) so
  `screens.encounter` / `.equipment` / `.newgame` + all templates reflect every edit above — NOT a
  hand-patch. Key-set diff guard passed (no screen/template lost). Figures/gear/worn sections
  regenerated by `roster_save.js` (4 races, mounts reconciled into `roster_gen.js` so a regenerate no
  longer reverts them — closes CD_STATUS #34.3).

## c) Rebuilt from disk
- `asset-manifest.js` + `Content.mgcb` rebuilt from disk — **2298 PNGs** (was ~1309; +~989 from the two
  new races' body parts + worn set + minion sprites). Both walkers were parallelized (the serial walk
  outgrew the 30s script budget at this asset count).
- **Screen renders refreshed (13 total, all verified 1920×1080):** `design/01-encounter-<core>.png` ×6,
  `design/02-equipment-<core>.png` ×6, `design/05-newgame.png`. `design/00-assets-1-figures.png` +
  `proto/roster_mockup.png` rebuilt with a race-morph comparison row + the full 24 race×core grid.
  (03-citymap / 04-campaignmap / 06-style / 07-merchant / 08-reticle unchanged this pass.)

## d) Manual design edits / user-accepted decisions (Doug/user) — intentional, not generator output
- **Doug: race art calls** — Dwarf shorter + wider/shorter head "to rip the bandaid off on body morph";
  Halfling elf-like with a shorter head "but not awkwardly and without the pale color."
- **Doug: HELD on Equipment** — "it's actually read-only technically" during combat; badge only.
- **Doug: stat-bonus display** — boxes consistent with the race attr boxes; Grunt shows all 4 (not
  summarized); center the ones with fewer; Loadout just adds it up (no separate badges); the race+core
  aggregated "+2 ALL" chip row was tried and REVERTED (identity block shows core-only; pools add it up).
- **Doug: core cards** — bigger, 3 per page, paged like the other pagers.
- **v6 loadout accuracy (Doug's balance session is gospel):** Ranger's melee is now an **Iron Dagger**
  (v6), not the short sword; Summoner's Barkskin (T1 INT shield) + Sacrifice; Adept's Siphon +
  Stoneskin; Bandage/Frenzy/Flurry/Aimed Shot costs are the v6 sheet numbers.

## FYI / open on our side
- **B18 technique/minion GLYPH icons** — the minion DEPLOY sprites shipped; the technique glyph PNGs
  (frenzy/flurry/aimed_shot/siphon/barkskin/sacrifice) are still an ASSET_GEN capture pass (CD_STATUS
  #34.4), not in this drop. Action bar renders the design-font glyph meanwhile — no 404 regression, the
  imageBind just falls through until the capture lands.
- **Body-MORPH composition (§7/§17 #15)** — the worn-armor parts are per (race, slot), core-agnostic
  (except themed); how they compose with per-core figure geometry + the new race build deltas is still
  the engine/morph question. The art convention proceeds; flagged, not blocking.
- **Ranger DEX utilization (v6 §E):** Human Ranger's full kit needs DEX 10 but even a healthy Human
  pool is 9 — so the heavy Aimed Shot lapses at full activation (shown as utilization in the Encounter
  render). Halfling Ranger fits it exactly. This is the v6 mono-attribute-scaling flag surfacing in UI,
  not a bug.
