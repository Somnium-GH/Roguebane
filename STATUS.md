# Status

## ⇒ BUG REPORT — HiFi, HIGH PRIORITY (2026-07-04, Doug — Equipment's minion bay renders completely
## blank; can't enable/disable a minion)
Doug's screenshot: "MINIONS - 1 / 1 slotted" header is correct, but the card area below is entirely
empty. **ROOT CAUSE FOUND, same class as the earlier coreStats/waresShelves sizing bugs:** the
Equipment `buildMinions` list element (`binds:"minions"`) is authored `size:[94,89]` and does NOT
override `item.size`, so it falls back to `templates.loadoutCard`'s own size **`[131,89]`** — wider
than the container itself. `ListLayout.Cells`'s horizontal-flow overflow check
(`Roguebane.Core/Layout/ListLayout.cs`: "cells past the region edge drop") fails on the very FIRST
cell (`131 > 94`), so it returns ZERO cells — no minion card can ever render here, regardless of how
many are slotted. Compare `loadoutList` (the TECHNIQUES action bar, same `loadoutCard` template):
its container is `[681,89]` with `item.size` explicitly re-stated as `[131,89]` — plenty of room for
~5 cards. `buildMinions` just never got sized for even one. **Fix: widen `buildMinions.size[0]` to
fit `Bays × (131+gap)`** (matching how `loadoutList` sizes for its technique-bar width) — logged to
CD (`CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`) since layout.json regenerates externally.
**Separately, "can't enable or disable minion" — activation MODEL + click wiring DONE (2026-07-04
loop):** the model piece was real (Doug's caution not to treat this as a quick wiring fix held) —
`Caster.Summon`/`Dismiss` already tracked "is this minion currently summoned" via the bay list, but
nothing at the `Expedition` level bridged that to the owned-minion pool the way `EquipTechnique`/
`UnequipTechnique` do for techniques. Added `Expedition.SummonMinion`/`DismissMinion` plus Game1
MINIONS-tab click handling (see P2 ORDERING entry below for the full writeup). **The blank-render
half of this bug is UNCHANGED** — `buildMinions`'s `layout.json` sizing bug (returns zero cells
regardless of click wiring) still needs the CD-side fix logged to `CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`; a card
still won't be visible to click until that lands.

## ⇒ NEW DIRECTIVE — HiFi, HIGH PRIORITY (2026-07-04, Doug): gate must test NON-16:9 resolutions ✅ DONE (2026-07-04 loop)
`tools/ui_gate.py` now runs every driven pass TWICE: the existing 1920x1080 reference size, plus a
second pass at 1600x1000 (non-16:9, exercises §13 aspect-fill's DesignW/DesignH extension that the
16:9 reference size structurally never reaches). New checks, both pinned zero (no baseline ride):
(1) `SMOKE SCENECOVER` (`Game1.cs`) samples 8 points (corners + edge-midpoints) of every screen with a
`*.scene`-bound backdrop against the raw clear colour right after the backdrop-only render — any
sample still showing clear means the backdrop didn't reach that part of the current canvas. Ran at
both sizes on every screen: **0 gaps everywhere** — the earlier backdrop-drift fix holds under an
actual non-16:9 render, not just by code inspection. (2) TEXTGEOM (overflow/collide/truncated) is
captured at the off-aspect size too, in its own `ui_baseline.json` lane (`textgeom_offaspect`) so a
legitimate aspect-driven reflow difference never gets conflated with the 16:9 numbers.
**Needs human — found in the same pass, not fixed here (out of scope for a gate-instrumentation
task):** `tools/ui_baseline.json` hasn't been rebaselined since commit `2249948` ("Equipment gate pass
rides a ref-aligned grunt drive"), and ~15 functional commits have landed since (drag-and-drop §6e,
the three targeting bugs, the gear-sustain cascade, the Equipment-screen reservation fix). Running
`python tools/ui_gate.py` right now (both at 1920x1080 and 1600x1000) reports real baseline drift:
fidelity drops on `encounter` (78.0→75.6) and `equipment` (74.7→71.6), and text overflow/collision
COUNTS ROSE on every single screen (e.g. equipment 11→28 overflow, 3→8 collide). Some of this is
probably legitimate reflow from the real UI changes above (new coreEffect/attrReadout content, the
drag-chrome placeholder, etc.) — but a fidelity DROP can also hide a genuine visual regression, so
this needs a human (or CD) eyeball on the worst-offender ELEM lines before anyone runs `--update`
blind. Don't rebaseline this without looking first.

## ⇒ BUG REPORT — HiFi (2026-07-04, Doug — three targeting bugs) — ALL RESOLVED (2026-07-04 loop, 370 tests)
1. ~~Reticle SNAPS to a part's center instead of following the raw cursor~~ DONE: `Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`
   now always draws the aiming reticle at the raw cursor; part detection (`FoePartAt`) still runs every
   frame for the click-to-aim hit-test, it just never repositions the sprite. DESIGN_SPEC's corrected
   wording stands.
2. ~~Hit-test uses a crude 4-band approximation, not real part geometry or Z-order~~ DONE: `Game1.cs`
   `FoePartAt` now walks the figure's real per-part rects (same transform `FoePartScreenRect` uses for
   drawing) in `Figure.Z` paint order back-to-front, so an overlapping hit resolves to the frontmost part
   (chest over arms). `PartBand`/old `FoePartRect` band approximation removed.
3. ~~Targeting/aim state isn't cleared at fight end~~ DONE: `Expedition.Redeploy()`/`Retreat()` now call a
   new `ClearAllAims()` clearing every equipped technique's `Aim` before returning to Choosing. Covered by
   two new headless tests (`RedeployClearsStaleAim`, `RetreatClearsStaleAim`).

## ‼ HUMAN DIRECTIVES — 2026-07-04 (Doug — explicit priority order, WINS over everything below;
## work this block TOP-DOWN before returning to normal-priority bugs/debt)

**P1. Fix the merchant screen** — already logged above/below as two precise bugs, nothing new to add:
the `waresShelves` 1-pixel-short container dropping the 3rd wares section (CD ask B13), and the
missing wareCard root border/chrome in the merchant's card-stamping path (pure engine fix, both
already in this file).

**P2. Fix Equipment/Technique inventory "button" states:**
- ~~All inventory cards render as if EQUIPPED regardless of real state~~ RESOLVED — see the
  "✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop) — invCard/loadoutCard states (§6e)" entry further down this file;
  duplicate bullet, nothing left to do here.
- Placeholder box currently marks "equipped" on figure parts where real worn-armor ASSETS already
  exist (B2-GO/B12) — wire the real assets in as they land, retire the box per-slot as its asset
  arrives (don't wait for the whole batch; flag any slot still on the box placeholder as Needs-CD if
  the asset genuinely isn't there yet).
- ~~Enabling/disabling a technique must add/remove it from the bottom action bar~~ RESOLVED
  (2026-07-04): the inventory toggle only flipped Caster activation, never roster membership. Added
  `Expedition.EquipTechnique`/`UnequipTechnique` (roster-only, capped at the chassis's `Kit.Count`,
  never touches attribute reservation per the "Reservation timing" lock) and mirrored on `Campaign` so
  the change survives a leg advance; `Game1`'s `ToggleTech` now calls these in-run. Also fixed a
  dead-card bug found in the same pass: the TECHNIQUES-tab click loop only indexed `_build.Palette`,
  so a merchant-bought technique's card (rendered per §12) was unclickable — click loop now matches
  the renderer's combined list.
- **Drag-and-drop reorder — DESIGN_SPEC §6e, "Reorder = DRAG-AND-DROP"** (found it, no need to ask
  Doug): dragging a slotted card pulls it off leaving a matching ghost background in its slot; snaps
  INSERTION-style between neighbors (sticky, easy); release locks the new order; same model for
  minion bays. Two ASSUMED defaults flagged there if they're wrong: drop-outside-the-bar snaps back
  (cancel), dragging a palette card onto the bar equips at the insertion point.
  **PART 1 DONE (2026-07-04):** Core primitive landed —
  `Expedition.ReorderTechnique(technique, newIndex)`/`Campaign.ReorderTechnique` (out-of-combat gated,
  clamps out-of-range index, mirrors into `_loadout` so order survives a leg advance; touches neither
  reservation nor activation).
  **PART 2 DONE (2026-07-04):** Game1 interactive half landed — press a slotted card, cross a small
  drag threshold, release to drop at the slot nearest the cursor (`Campaign.ReorderTechnique`); a press
  under threshold still plain-clicks (toggle); drop outside the bar cancels (the ASSUMED default).
  Draw side has a PLACEHOLDER ghost-dim + insertion-ring visual (flagged Needs Claude Design for real
  chrome — no authored drag chrome exists yet). Only wired in-run; pre-run has no persisted bar order.
  **Minion-bay reorder — Core primitive DONE (2026-07-04 loop):** `Caster._bays` switched from an
  id-sorted `SortedDictionary` to a slot-ordered `List<Minion>` (§6e "slot index IS the hotkey" — a
  fresh Summon appends to the first free slot, Dismiss compacts left); new `Caster.ReorderMinion`
  mirrors `Expedition.ReorderTechnique`'s clamp/remove/insert exactly, plus a thin
  `Expedition.ReorderMinion` wrapper gated on `Choosing`. No `Campaign`-level mirror needed (Campaign
  already hands every leg the same `Caster` instance, so bay order persists across leg advances for
  free). 4 new headless tests, 377/377 green.
  **Minion activation MODEL + click wiring — DONE (2026-07-04 loop):** the missing primitive Doug's
  B14 flagged (below) — `Expedition.SummonMinion`/`DismissMinion`, thin `Choosing`-gated wrappers over
  `Caster.Summon`/`Dismiss` (`Caster.Dismiss` now returns `bool`), mirroring `EquipTechnique`/
  `UnequipTechnique` exactly: ownership (chassis kit + rune grants + bought stash) is untouched by
  summon/dismiss, same as equipping a technique never removes it from the palette. Game1's MINIONS
  tab (`_invTab == 2`) now has click handling (`InRun`-gated, same pattern as GEAR): click an
  equippable card to summon into a free bay, click an equipped card to dismiss it back out. 4 new
  headless tests, 381/381 green.
  **Minion-bay drag-reorder — DONE (2026-07-04 loop):** `Game1.UpdateBayDrag` mirrors
  `UpdateBarDrag`/`WithinBar`/`DragInsertionIndex` for the `buildMinions` strip (`binds: "minions"`),
  calling `ReorderMinion` on drop and `DismissMinion` on a plain click (every card in this strip is
  already bayed, so there's no "equip" case here — that's the MINIONS tab grid's job). Kept as its
  own method rather than genericizing `UpdateBarDrag`, since `Technique`/`Minion` are different
  payload types and the duplication is small. In-run only, same as the click wiring above.
  **NOTE: inert until CD lands the fix** — `buildMinions` still renders zero cells (the B14
  cell-overflow sizing bug, container `[94,89]` vs `loadoutCard` item `[131,89]`, logged to CD in
  `CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`); this wiring is the correct, tested code-side completion, just waiting
  on that container to widen.
  **Palette-drag-to-equip — DONE (2026-07-04 loop), closes the P2 drag-and-drop item entirely:**
  the second ASSUMED default ("dragging a palette card onto the bar equips at the insertion point")
  is now built for BOTH bars. `UpdateBarDrag`/`UpdateBayDrag` take a palette slot/data source
  alongside the bar's own; a press can now start on an unequipped tab-grid card, and dropping it
  onto the bar calls `EquipTechnique`/`SummonMinion` then `ReorderTechnique`/`ReorderMinion` to place
  it at the drop point (no new Core primitives — pure composition of already-tested calls). This
  required folding the TECHNIQUES/MINIONS tab grids' old immediate press-toggle into the same
  press/drag/release state machine the bars use (otherwise a plain click would've toggled twice —
  once on press via the old inline `Click()`, once on release via the new drag logic); a release
  without a qualifying drag still behaves as a plain click. GEAR tab untouched (single-slot, no bar).
  381/381 (Core unchanged this pass), `dotnet build` clean. **Both ASSUMED defaults from the DESIGN_SPEC
  §6e drag-and-drop item are now built; nothing left open here except the already-flagged Needs-CD
  visual chrome (ghost-dim/insertion-ring placeholder) and the B14 `buildMinions` sizing gap above.**

**P3. Fix equipment reservation + the "everyone can activate their default kit" balance pass:**
- ~~**Equipment currently reserves nothing cumulatively.**~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop): the SUSTAIN MODEL
  (`Body.cs`'s `DisabledGear` DISABLE CASCADE) already gives every piece of gear sharing a stat a single
  shared pool, disabling highest-requirement-first when the combined reserve exceeds what's left after
  techniques take their share — equip-time (`Wield`/`EquipRanged`/`Equip`) stays a raw-capacity gate by
  design (SUSTAIN MODEL note in `Body.cs`), sustain is the cumulative check. Covered by
  `ArmorLineTests`/`WandTests`/`FoeArmingTests`/`FoeOffenseTests`/`MitigationTests`.
- ~~**Regression, separately: techniques must NOT reserve attributes in the Equipment screen at all**~~
  DONE (2026-07-04 loop): added `Body.RangedGearOnlyUsable`/`HandItemGearOnlyUsable`/
  `ArmorGearOnlySustained` (the same disable cascade with technique reservation zeroed) and pointed the
  Equipment screen's card resolver (`Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`'s `InvCardState`) at them. The real,
  TechReserved-inclusive checks (`RangedUsable`/`HandItemUsable`/`ArmorSustained`) are untouched, so
  in-combat resolution and the paper-doll draw keep reading true capability. New tests in
  `BodyTests.cs` prove a lingering active technique disables the real check but not the gear-only one.
- ~~**Balance pass:** scale race base attributes UP...~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop): turned out to already
  hold in substance from the earlier "Human bump" (Races.cs) — that pass raised attributes generally
  for the cumulative SUSTAIN MODEL, but nothing directly asserted the specific property P3 asks for.
  Added two headless tests closing that coverage gap: `StartingKitTests.
  EveryRaceAndCoreEquipsItsWholeDefaultKit` (armor + weapon kit, whole race roster incl. frail Elf,
  Con 7) and `CoreCampaignTests.EveryRaceAndCoreActivatesEveryDefaultTechniqueSimultaneously` (embarks
  every race×core, toggles every default technique, asserts all stay active). Both pass on the
  CURRENT numbers — no attribute retune was needed, this was a missing-test gap, not a missing-tune
  gap. 383/383 green. **P3 fully closed.**

**Other bugs from this same pass, normal priority (not ahead of P1-P3, but don't lose them):**
- ~~Techniques start fully charged at encounter start — should need to WARM UP~~ **HALF DONE (2026-07-04
  loop):** `Caster.RearmForEncounter()` rewinds every active Timered technique's cooldown and every
  bayed minion's timer to full at the moment a node resolves into a fight (`Expedition.Enter`), so
  leftover mid-charge/ready state from the PREVIOUS encounter can no longer buy an instant free
  discharge in the next one. 385/385 green (2 new Caster tests pin the rewind for both a technique and
  a minion). **This is the charge-clock half only — see Needs human below for the other half.**
- **Needs human — the on/off half of this LOCK is genuinely blocked, not just unbuilt:** DESIGN_SPEC
  says every technique/minion should start NEUTRAL ("off") each encounter, not just uncharged, which
  reads as "deactivate everything, player re-arms every fight." For TECHNIQUES that's cheap and safe
  (Deactivate/re-Toggle costs nothing beyond the stat reservation, which already frees on Deactivate) —
  but it's a real UX change from today's campaign-wide toggle-once model (`CoreCampaignTests`), so
  it's a judgment call, not just an engine fix. For MINIONS it's worse: `Caster.Summon` spends 1
  `SummonsLeft` on EVERY successful call, with no "free reactivation" path distinct from a fresh
  summon — so literally Dismissing a minion at encounter end and re-Summoning it next encounter would
  silently burn the finite Summons resource every single fight, which can't be the intended design.
  Making minions truly start "disabled" without that resource bug needs a NEW primitive (an enable/
  disable bit orthogonal to bay membership, free to flip) that isn't specified yet. Don't guess-build
  this (CLAUDE.md: no undesigned mechanics) — Doug's call on: (a) do techniques really re-arm EVERY
  encounter, or does "beginning of an encounter" mean the start of a fresh RUN only (FTL's actual
  parity — systems stay powered between fights once set); (b) if per-encounter, what's the free
  minion re-enable primitive.

**Then: all other bugs/debt in this file, business as usual for the loop.**

## ⇒ BUG REPORT — HiFi, HIGH PRIORITY (2026-07-03, Doug — Merchant only shows 2 of 3 wares sections;
## a 3rd appears once you buy out one of the visible two)
Doug's screenshots show WEAPONS+ARMOR, then (after buying out Armor) WEAPONS+MINIONS — a 3rd stocked
section is present in the DATA the whole time but invisible until an earlier row empties out and the
list re-flows. **ROOT CAUSE FOUND, exact and tiny:** `layout.json`'s merchant `waresShelves` list
(`offset [254,61]`, **size `[692,377]`**) stamps `item:{template:"shopSection", flow:"vertical",
gap:12, size:[692,118]}`. Three rows need `3×118 + 2×12 = 378px` — the container is **377px, ONE
PIXEL SHORT.** `ListLayout.Cells`'s vertical-flow overflow rule (`Roguebane.Core/Layout/ListLayout.cs`:
"cells past the region edge drop instead of spilling") silently drops the entire 3rd row for missing
by 1px — it doesn't clip/partial-render, it just omits it. `MerchantPageCount()` (`SectionsPerPage=3`)
correctly computes "1 page" for a 3-section stock, since its math never touches this geometry — so
"PAGE 1/1" is technically correct, the bug is purely that only 2 of the page's 3 rows fit on screen.
When a bought-out section's ware list empties, that section drops from `MerchantSections()` entirely,
the remaining sections re-index, and the previously-clipped 3rd section slides into a now-visible
slot — matching Doug's exact "buy one out and another appears" description. **Fix: bump
`waresShelves.size[1]` from 377 to at least 378 (fresh margin recommended, e.g. 382+)** — logged to CD
(`CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`) since layout.json regenerates externally; a local one-pixel patch here
would just get overwritten on the next drop.

## ✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop) — background stays put, everything drawn over it shifts
Doug refined the report: not text-specific — "anything on top of the background" shifts, screenshots
confirmed on campaignmap and merchant (arrows: node/legend chrome adrift from the map's line art;
wares grid and footer/purse floating away from the wall/skyline backdrop). **Root cause found by
static read**: every screen's `*.scene`-bound backdrop element (`backdrop`, one per screen in
layout.json) is authored `anchor:"Center"` with a size hardcoded to the base 16:9 design
(`[960,540]`). `EnsureSceneMatchesBackbuffer` extends `_ui.DesignW`/`DesignH` past that base whenever
the window's aspect isn't exactly 16:9 — true for almost any real monitor when maximized — and
edge-anchored chrome correctly re-pins to the new real edges (§13 aspect-fill, working as designed).
The backdrop's fixed-size box just recenters inside the bigger canvas instead of covering it: it
stops moving while everything anchored to the real edges moves outward around it. Exactly Doug's
symptom. Fixed in `Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`: scene elements (the existing `.scene`-bind convention)
now resolve to the full current design canvas (`ManifestUi.FullCanvasRect`) instead of their authored
anchor/offset/size, in both `DrawManifestScreen` and `DrawManifestBackdrop`. Build clean, RB_SMOKE
all-screens clean (no new collisions/overflow vs. baseline — smoke runs at the 16:9 base extent where
old and new rects coincide, so it can't regress there), 350/350 tests green. **Needs Doug**: confirm
live on an actual maximize — smoke can't drive a non-16:9 backbuffer to see the stretch itself.

## (superseded by the fix above, kept for history) — HiFi BUG REPORT (2026-07-03, Doug — all text
## shifts upward uniformly when the window is MAXIMIZED; windowed mode is correct)
Doug: happens on "pretty much everywhere" (merchant wares, Equipment's core/technique/minion foot
strip, others) — consistent, uniform upward shift specifically on maximize (not general resize; per
STATUS history, resizing to other arbitrary sizes like 1600×1000 was previously verified clean, so
this looks maximize-specific, not a generic aspect-fill bug). **Traced the render pipeline
(`Game1.cs` `EnsureSceneMatchesBackbuffer` / `UpdateViewport` / the final scene blit) and it's clean —
no hardcoded offsets, no title-bar math, `_viewDest` is always `(0,0,scene.Width,scene.Height)` and
the scene is drawn at 1:1.** Couldn't find a static-code smoking gun; this needs a LIVE repro (no
dotnet in this sandbox to run it). Two concrete things to check on an actual build: (1) whether
`GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferWidth/Height` reports a stale/transient value
immediately after the OS maximize event (a known MonoGame/SDL timing quirk) — add a one-line debug
print of `bw,bh,_scene.Width,_scene.Height` right after maximizing; (2) the early-return guard in
`EnsureSceneMatchesBackbuffer` (`if (_scene is not null && _scene.Width==bw && _scene.Height==bh)
return;`) — if maximize fires the resize event more than once with an intermediate wrong size, the
scene could latch onto that intermediate size and never get corrected. **(2) is largely RULED OUT by
static reading (2026-07-04 loop):** `EnsureSceneMatchesBackbuffer` isn't event-driven — it's called
unconditionally at the top of every `Draw` (`Game1.cs:643`), not once off a resize callback. Any
single-frame stale/intermediate `bw,bh` would just fail the `==` check again next frame and re-resize
to the (by-then-correct) value — a persistent forever-shifted result can't come from a one-time latch
on this path. Doesn't rule out (1) (a PresentationParameters read that's stale for the FULL session,
not just one frame) or something maximize-specific outside this file (OS chrome/DPI scaling changing
`W`/`H`/`SS` inputs some other way) — still needs the live instrumented run. Flagging as HiFi/high-priority
since it's visible everywhere, but it's a repro-and-instrument task, not something foldable from a
screenshot alone.

## ✅ DROP REVIEWED — B12 CORRECTED worn-armor set LANDED CLEAN (2026-07-04, Cowork). The morning
## mis-build (type×core×race cross-product + a "plain" type) is FULLY FIXED. Art verified exact; the
## build-integration steps below are the loop's — a few couldn't be verified from the Cowork sandbox
## (git desynced from the working tree + layout.json mount serves stale reads + no dotnet), so they're
## flagged to VERIFY, not asserted broken.
**VERIFIED GREEN (reliable file/dir checks):** `Roguebane.Content/sprites/gear/worn/<race>/<slot>/…`
= **744 files, 0 missing / 0 extra** against the enumerated target (bare 24 + generic 240 + themed 480).
No `plain` type (unarmored terminal is `bare`); **cross-product leak check EMPTY** — every themed
sprite's type equals its core's favored line (grunt/warden→str, adept/summoner→int, reaver/ranger→dex).
Slot coverage correct: arms/legs carry str+dex only (no int, no adept/summoner themes); int = chest+head
only; every part cooked per race (human+elf). No leftover mis-built `sprites/body/*_(str|dex|int)_*`
contamination. CD's `design/dchtml/DROP_AUDIT.md` documents the retraction of the morning cross-product
build + matches the spec (themes per core; elf_ranger neckline strap now mid-chest; bow/sling back-mount
art also shipped). **The mis-build Doug flagged is resolved.**
**LOOP FOLLOW-UPS (build integration — the art is done, these wire it in; normal priority):**
1. ~~GAME-side mgcb mirror~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop). Transformed all 744 `sprites/gear/worn/…`
   CD-source blocks into the game-side path/output-name convention and appended to
   `Roguebane.Game/Content/Content.mgcb`; `dotnet build` clean, all 744 worn xnbs produced.
2. ~~layout.json top-level `worn` block~~ VERIFIED PRESENT (2026-07-04 loop): `layout.json:10373`
   carries the compact `worn` inventory (root/races/slots); manifest parses fine under SMOKE.
3. **Engine: themed half + DRAW code.** e1c8291 landed the GENERIC resolver half; still pending — the
   THEMED override (fires only when the worn line == figure core's favored line, §7a) + the actual
   worn-part/back-mount DRAW (part selection by race/slot/wear-state; back-mount behind legL), per CD
   audit → DEV_LOOP_MEMORY #32. Fallback chain per §12a. **Only item still open from this drop.**
4. ~~Build-verify + SMOKE asset-exists probe~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop): `RB_SMOKE=1 RB_MF=all` reports
   `SMOKE ASSETS: missing=0` (2 unverifiable are pre-existing, unrelated placeholders) and
   `SMOKE FIGURES: armored-missing=0`; Core.Tests 350 green. Eyeballing a themed figure live still
   wants item 3's DRAW code first — nothing renders differently yet, only the pipeline is proven.
_Scope note: this review targeted the worn-armor correction Doug flagged. The rest of the drop CD's
audit claims (B1b/B4/B7/B8/B10/B11, weapons/families/back-mount) rides the loop's normal landed-audit —
not re-verified here._

## ⇒ CD MEMORY-DROP RECONCILE (2026-07-03, Cowork) — CD's dev-loop memory audited vs repo; most
## items were STALE ON CD'S SIDE (already landed here), one real NEW engine bug surfaced.
Reconciled CD's 11-item OPEN list against actual repo state (grepped layout.json/renderer, didn't
trust either side's claim). **CLOSED/LANDED, no action (CD's memory is stale, nothing to do):**
`core.label` bind (B0b, already closed); border.sides (fully wired, 8 call sites); shield-pool
pips (variable-N instancing + wrap already built, STATUS 756-758); merchant screen consumer + buy/
leave (already wired — CD's "still shows popover stopgap" claim is stale, only the wareCard root-
chrome bug, already tracked below, remains real). **No action, CD-side or non-blocking:** chrome/
background fidelity (CD's own art priority); rich-text-run flattening (accepted, tracked as A3);
merchant-specific pagination is built, but the GENERIC container overflow/scroll model CD asked for
doesn't exist as a primitive — low-priority engine debt, nothing currently blocked on it.
**✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop) — invCard/loadoutCard states (§6e):** CD's B5 (family keys) and B6
(vocabulary rename + hover variants) were fully landed in `layout.json`, but `InvCardState()`
(`Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`) still returned the pre-rename vocabulary (`equipped`/`dropped`/
`ready`/`neutral`), and the root-chrome family switch didn't recognize the `invCard`/`loadoutCard`
family values at all (unrecognized family short-circuited to null, bypassing the generic
`equipped`-key fallback that used to resolve them pre-B5) — so every inventory/loadout card drew
base chrome regardless of real state. Fixed both: added explicit `"invCard" or "loadoutCard" =>
InvCardState(datum)` family cases, and rewrote `InvCardState()`'s return values to the locked
`equipped`/`disabled`/`equippable`/`locked` vocabulary. Verified: build clean, RB_SMOKE all-screens
no regressions, 350/350 Core.Tests green. (The `invTab` portion of this report is stale — no
`invTab` template exists in current `layout.json`; nothing to fix there.)
**Outbox update:** B5 and B6 marked confirm-to-close in `outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md` (CD
delivered; thank them, clear from CD's dev memory) — the follow-up above was ours, not relayed.
**Item 27 reminder reconfirmed unchanged:** NewGame stat-block tuning session still pending
(don't adopt design/05 v2 numbers); §13 aspect-fill already DONE (STATUS 691-696) — no action.

## ⇒ NEW LOCK (2026-07-03, Doug): merchant presence-roll weights, DESIGN_SPEC §12
Doug: keep the RANDOMIZED per-category stocking (don't flatten to "always show all 5" for the POC) —
"the advanced prototype" already IS `MerchantStock.cs`'s existing weighted-roll shape, just locked
now instead of flagged placeholder/OPEN. **No new engine behavior needed — this is a doc/test-status
change, not a code change:** Armor/Weapons/Minions = 80% independent presence roll each, Techniques =
25%, Runes = 8% (+ a 33% survival roll for rank-2+ Marks), capped at 4-of-5 sections, keystones never.
Folded into DESIGN_SPEC §12 as LOCKED. **Loop follow-up (small):** `MerchantStockTests.cs`'s header
comment still says "the exact section weights are OPEN (§17) — these tests pin the locked SHAPE, not
the odds" — update that comment (now stale) and consider adding a statistical presence-rate assertion
across the existing 400-seed sweep (e.g. Techniques appearing in roughly 20-30% of seeds) now that
the numbers themselves are locked, not just the shape. Not urgent, no P0 jump.

## ⇒ CORRECTION to the "ghost head — FIXED" answer above (2026-07-03, Doug caught it live)
The fix picked the WRONG part to keep. Recap: `raceCard` had two overlapping head parts — (1)
`imageBind` bound to `race.headImage`, rect `[1,1,53,77]` (aspect 0.69, portrait); (2) a static
unbound part hardcoded to `human_grunt`, rect `[10,22,35,35]` (aspect 1.0, square) + drop shadow. The
P0-C.9 fix suppressed #2 as "unbound mock filler" and kept #1 — but **source head art is landscape**
(`elf_grunt/head_healthy.png` = 152×104, aspect 1.46) and part #1's portrait rect (0.69) stretches it
FAR worse than part #2's square rect (1.0) did. Doug's live shots confirm: keeping #1 = the visibly
stretched/elongated head; #2 (now suppressed) was the better-proportioned one, just wrongly bound to
`human_grunt`. **Real fix isn't "pick the other part" — it's that the imageBind almost certainly
landed on the wrong element during extraction.** Likely intent: part #2's geometry (square, shadowed
— reads as the actual framed portrait) should carry the LIVE `race.headImage` imageBind; part #1
(gradient fill + right border, spanning the whole card-corner) is probably the BACKGROUND PANEL and
was never meant to carry an image at all. This is a CD extraction mis-attribution, not a pick-one
engine call — logged to CD (`CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`) rather than re-guessing locally.

## ✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop) — CityMap war-party icon now tracks the doom bar's fill boundary
`doomHost` was a plain static bindless image at a fixed offset. Extended the same sibling-detection
stopgap already used for `doomFillStripes`: find the `enemy.advancePct`-bound sibling, find the plain
panel sharing its right edge (the track), offset the icon's draw X to `trackR.X + frac*trackR.Width -
iconWidth/2`. Structural detection, not a doomHost-specific case. Build clean, Core.Tests 350 green.
**Needs Doug**: RB_SMOKE runs pre-run so this branch is inert there by design — needs a live in-run
screenshot to visually confirm.

## ✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop) — Merchant wareCards render with no border/chrome
Root chrome was missing because `section.wares` stamping (`Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`) called
`DrawWarePart` per part only, skipping `DrawTemplateRootChrome`. Added the root-chrome call per
ware card before its parts stamp, same as every other templated card family. Build clean,
RB_SMOKE=1 RB_MF=all clean on merchant, Core.Tests 350 green. The rarity badge (`ware.tag`) gap
is untouched — separate, already-known, no rarity model built yet.

## ⇒ BUG REPORT — HiFi, HIGH PRIORITY (2026-07-03, Doug — Equipment identity block, bays/actions/budget)
Doug's screenshot (Elf Summoner) shows BAYS and ACTIONS crammed onto the same line and BUDGET
orphaned alone on the next — not three clean stacked rows. **ROOT CAUSE FOUND in the manifest data,
not engine math** — traced `ListLayout.Cells` (`Roguebane.Core/Layout/ListLayout.cs`, pure/tested,
behaving exactly per its documented grid contract: wraps left→right then top→bottom, columns fit by
region width) against the actual authored element. Equipment's `coreStats` list element (bind
`core.stats`, 3 items: bays/actions/budget) is authored `"flow":"grid", "cols":2, "size":[131,16]`
with its row template (`coreStatRow`) at `size:[62,7]`, `gap:2`. Region width 131 fits floor(133/64)=2
columns — so item 0 (bays) lands col0/row0, item 1 (actions) lands col1/row0 (**same row as bays**),
item 2 (budget) lands col0/row1 alone. (Note: the authored `"cols":2` hint isn't even read by
`ListLayout.Cells` — it derives column count itself from region width — so it's redundant with, not
the cause of, the 2-col wrap; removing it alone won't fix anything.) **This is a CD data-authoring
mismatch, not an engine bug** — a 3-item label/value list wants a single-column vertical stack (e.g.
`flow:"vertical"`, container sized ~`[62,25]` for 3 rows of 7px + 2 gaps), not a 2-col grid sized for
4 cells. Logged to CD (`outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md` B3) for the generator-side fix since
layout.json is regenerated externally and a local hand-patch here would just get clobbered on the
next drop. **Not a queue-jump — HiFi bugs stay flagged top-of-queue per standing rule, fold into the
next pass/drop that touches Equipment's identity block.**

## ✅ ANSWERED (2026-07-03 loop, same day — all three HiFi items below)
1. **Ghost head — FIXED:** the P0-C.9 unbound-filler rule now covers Race datums' STATIC-IMAGE
parts — the leftover human_grunt head mock no longer draws under the live `race.headImage`
imageBind (verified on the gate crop: single head per card, Elf wears its own sprite). The mock
part itself stays a Needs-CD extraction leftover.
2. **eyebrow×title collision — FIXED:** the `core.coreEffect` BLOCK's flattened sample IS the
source's eyebrow, mis-attributed the block's display/8px style (dc.html authors mono 9px = 4.5
design px, mutedDim). Drawn per the source now — crop clean, ng fidelity 78.6→79.4. Extraction
mis-attribution logged Needs-CD.
3. **Selected-card amber ring — WAS WRONGLY CLEARED HERE, since RE-FOUND AND ACTUALLY FIXED
(2026-07-04 loop):** this "stale build" verdict was wrong — the bug was real and reproducible
regardless of build freshness. `DrawTemplateRootChrome` (`Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`) bailed out
before ever consulting the `states` block whenever a template's ROOT had no `fill`/`border` — true
of coreCard, which defines chrome only per-state. See the "✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop)" entry above
for the actual root cause and fix.

## ✅ DUPLICATE, ALREADY FIXED (found 2026-07-04 loop) — race-card head portrait doubles/ghosts
Same root cause and same fix as the "ghost head — FIXED" entry above: `7ad61c9` already extends the
P0-C.9 unbound-static-image-part suppression to `Race` datums (`Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`, the
`datum is Roguebane.Core.Race && pp.Binds is null && pp.ImageBind is null && !string.IsNullOrEmpty
(pp.Image)` guard) — this entry pre-dates that commit landing and was never reconciled. No new work.

## ⇒ BUG REPORT — HiFi, HIGH PRIORITY (2026-07-03, Doug — NewGame core-picker card, live screenshots)
Doug shot the Grunt core card in three states (idle/SELECT, live selected/✓ CORE SET, and the design/05
reference) and found two real defects.
1. **CORE EFFECT text collision, CONFIRMED STILL OPEN:** the "CORE EFFECT" eyebrow visibly overlaps the
   "Hollow Vessel" title line in ALL THREE of Doug's shots (idle + selected) — this is the **`eyebrow×title`**
   member of the 3 known collisions baselined 2026-07-03 (STATUS history: heroShield-over-bar and the
   doubled-identity collision both DIED same day; eyebrow×title was never confirmed dead — the "post-A3
   re-judge (findings 4→3, ALL CD-side)" note covers NewGame's geometry deltas generally, NOT a specific
   re-check of this collision). Treat as a real, still-open regression, not a dupe to dismiss. **Not a
   stop-the-loop interrupt — fold into the next pass touching NewGame's cards**, HiFi bugs stay
   top-of-queue by standing rule regardless.

## ✅ FIXED (2026-07-04 loop) — Selected-card highlight (amber ring) NOT RENDERING
Root cause: `DrawTemplateRootChrome` (`Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`) bailed out early whenever the
TEMPLATE'S OWN root had no `fill`/`border` — before ever looking at its `states` block. coreCard defines
chrome ONLY per-state (`states.idle/hover/selected/locked`), nothing at the template root, so the guard
tripped unconditionally and the root ring never drew in ANY state, selected included. Manifest data was
already correct (`states.selected` carries `border:"amber", fill:"panelCard"` and resolved fine) — this
was purely an engine short-circuit. Removed the early-return guard; the existing per-token
`{Length:>0}` checks already no-op correctly for templates with genuinely no chrome at all. Build clean,
RB_SMOKE=1 RB_MF=all clean (no new collisions/coverage regressions), Core.Tests 350 green. **Needs Doug**:
confirm live — RB_SMOKE can't visually verify actual amber pixel output, only that nothing crashed/regressed.

## ⇒ NEW LOCK (2026-07-03, Doug — design session): weapon wield model, DESIGN_SPEC §6/§6d
**CORRECTED same day — §6d was rewritten twice; read the CURRENT §6d, not this summary, before building.**
Two independent equip layers: a MELEE hand-config (main-hand + off-hand, any 1H/2H pairing incl. 2H/2H,
gated purely by each weapon's own per-tier STR requirement — no separate one-hand-vs-two-hand threshold)
and ONE separate RANGED slot (bow/wand — does NOT compete with melee hands; a sword+shield AND a bow can
both be equipped at once, per the Ranger core). NEW ENGINE WORK this unblocks (not urgent, no P0 queue
jump — pick up in normal priority order): equip-config validation for both layers; lockout checks keyed
to ARM-BROKEN state (not the STR value) for ANY held weapon incl. ranged, on both player AND foes; a hard
evasion-zero when EITHER leg is broken, overriding residual DEX from Marks; main-hand/off-hand
auto-promotion bookkeeping (first-equipped wins main-hand); a new Left/Right-HANDEDNESS player setting
(cosmetic render-only); Bow + Wand weapon data entries (names in §6d). Wand's partial shield-bypass is
explicitly NOT numbered yet (§17 #18) — don't invent a split, block on design. **RESOLVED (2026-07-03,
POC-scope): no hand-timer gating between weapon families** — ranged and melee/shield techniques may
power/charge/fire in parallel; the only hand-related gate is the static arms-unbroken+equipped check
above, never a live "is this hand free" contention. Animation/sheathing is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE for
the prototype — don't let it invent a gameplay restriction. Separately, a SHIELD equipped IS a static
equip-time incompatibility with bows/wands (both need 2 free hands, same family as "shield needs a free
arm") — that's a real, LOCKED rule, not a timer thing. **Sling** (§6d/§10, §17 #20) is now shape-LOCKED:
1H (shield-compatible), fully bypasses the shield pool like a bow at lower damage, spends Charge — safe
to build against that shape; gating stat is an ASSUMED default (DEX, matching bows), not yet confirmed,
and tier names aren't set — don't invent those two.

## ⇒ NEW LOCK (2026-07-03, Doug — design session): armor system, DESIGN_SPEC §6/§6c
STR/DEX/INT/CON armor tier ladders + names are canon (§6c, blessed-initial numbers, tune later); shield
OBJECT equip-gate moved **STR → CON** (§6 table). **Needs-loop, not urgent — pick up whenever Equipment
gear cards are next touched:** ~~third border state~~ SUPERSEDED same day by the §6e states-session
LOCK (block below) — ALL FOUR states turn out to be CD-authored on `invCard` already (equipped=green /
dropped=red / ready=plain / neutral=dim); what's missing is the `states.family` key (payload B5) +
engine resolution + the armor model. Armor-RED per §6/§6c stands, folded into §6e.

## ⇒ NEW LOCK (2026-07-03, Doug — equipment-states session): DESIGN_SPEC §6e — Equipment card
## states, clicks, ordering, paper-doll. READ §6e before building; this is the summary, not the spec.
- **ONE 4-state family, all three inv tabs:** EQUIPPED(green) · DISABLED(red — assigned but
  unsustainable; incl. slotted techniques whose §6d weapon-gate is lost) · EQUIPPABLE(plain) ·
  LOCKED(dim — reqs unmet, or bar/bays FULL). Manifest names `equipped/dropped/ready/neutral`;
  CD asked for `states.family` keys (B5) + renames + HOVER variants (B6). ENGINE: resolve these
  state families on invCard/loadoutCard once family keys land — suggested interim (FLAGGED
  stopgap): a GENERIC fallback resolving states-without-family by template id; never a
  per-template enumerated special case (see the ghost-head lesson). A FLAGGED generic
  hover-brighten stopgap is approved until CD's hover states land.
- **Clicks (out-of-combat only):** equippable→equip · equipped→unequip · disabled→unequip · locked→
  inert. **AUTO-DISPLACE on conflicts:** legal equips always succeed; bow/wand benches a held shield;
  hands-full melee equip displaces the OFF-hand (never main, §6d promotion); armor swaps its slot.
  Capacity ≠ conflict (full bar/bays = dim palette cards, no displacement).
- **Ordering [hotkeys ARE slot order]:** click = slot into first free, unslot compacts, hotkeys
  renumber positionally. **DRAG-AND-DROP reorder (NEW input capability):** drag pulls the card off
  leaving a ghost in its slot, snaps insertion-style between neighbors, release locks the order; same
  model for minion bays. Supersedes the "mouse is click+hover only" Debt line WHEN BUILT. Assumed
  defaults flagged in §6e (drop-outside cancels; palette-drag equips at insertion point).
- **Disable cascade [§17 #16 RESOLVED — buildable now]:** highest-requirement-first, ties last-
  equipped-first; a pure ranking over the live attr level (recovery re-enables cheapest-first
  automatically). Core-test the ranking exhaustively — thesis-adjacent economy math.
- **Paper-doll = capability truth:** DISABLED gear is REMOVED from the render (no dimmed-armor art
  needed — scope savings flagged to CD in B6); a broken arm never draws its weapon; ranged mount
  while melee hands are full = §17 #22 (assumed NOT drawn — don't invent art).
- **Equipment renders LIVE run state only; the legacy pre-run build branch is vestigial — retire when
  next touched.** (BEGIN → CityMap; the screen is unreachable pre-run.)
- ENGINE ORDER (extends the §6d queue, normal priority, no queue-jump): armor items as data (§6c
  ladders) + gear/armor requirement checks → cascade ranking → state-family render wiring → click
  matrix + auto-displace → drag-reorder → paper-doll gear-state compose. Each slice Core-tested.

## ⇒ NEW LOCK (2026-07-03, Doug — weapon/armor NAMING + numbers session): DESIGN_SPEC §6c/§6d/§10
## rewritten — READ THE SPEC before building; this block is the engine queue, not the rules.
**What locked:** full weapon roster (STR/DEX melee ×3 types each ×2 hands, material tiers
Iron→Steel→**Mithral**→Dwarven Steel), per-tier damage + equip requirement + **technique-TIMER
MULTIPLIER** per weapon (<1.0 = faster; multiplies the consulting technique's charge timer;
dual-wield = AVERAGE of both weapons' multipliers, damage from BOTH); STR armor RENAMED to the same
material ladder on plain slot nouns (Helm/Breastplate/Vambraces/Greaves — old prestige names are §18
DROPPED, clean-rename any code/data usages); armor equip gates (STR 2/t · DEX 1/t · Robe 2 INT/t ·
Cap 1 INT/t); INT REDESIGN: wand = 1H hand item (dual-OK, excludes ranged slot, shield-legal,
**shield-SUBTRACTION damage** — reduced by standing shields, NOT consumed, NO Charge — supersedes
partial-bypass), staff = 2H plain blockable melee (blocks ranged like a held shield, no shield,
1 INT/t), magic offhands Charm/Tome (+0.1× minion/spell dmg per tier, 1 INT/t, pair with any main);
sling stat+names locked (DEX 1/t, Shepherd's→Braided→Sinew→Giantsbane).
**Still OPEN — do NOT invent:** bow + sling damage/tier; CON-shield equip-gate number (§6c);
placeholder-flagged values fine where content already exists (bow power 2 stays flagged).
**NEW ENGINE WORK (normal priority order, each slice Core-tested; content is DATA — one
interpreter, no per-weapon classes):**
1. ~~Weapon/armor DATA roster~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop, 326 tests): Weapon gains
   Name/Tier/Timer/Hands/Kind; `Armory` ships all 15 ladders (9 melee ×4 material tiers, bows,
   slings [dmg placeholders FLAGGED §17 #9], wands, staffs, charms, tomes; legacy
   sword/axe/dagger/bow ids kept on tier-1 pieces — gear sprites for the rest ride B2);
   STR armor renamed to the material ladder (prestige names §18-dropped); `Armor.Requirement`
   per-tier gates live in Body.Equip/Gearing + the Equipment card LOCKED state. Shield objects
   still deferred (CON gate never dictated). GEAR-CATALOG JOIN (2026-07-03 loop, 329 tests):
   weapon/armor ids RENAMED to the CD sprite convention (longsword_iron, armor_dex_head_plain...)
   so sprites/gear/{id} resolves mapping-free; contract test pins the join (bows exempt — no bow
   art shipped, Needs-CD B11); merchant/inventory rows read canon record Names (catalog display
   names DRIFTED from §6c — Needs-CD B10). Wand/offhand CONSUMERS = slices 3-4.
2. ~~Timer-multiplier~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop, 327 tests: EffectiveCooldown scales by the
   consulted weapons' AVERAGE timer on top of DEX haste — both knobs on one counter, balance-pass
   tunes the interaction; self-contained techniques untouched).
3. ~~Wand shield-subtraction~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop, 332 tests: a cast whose consulted weapons
   are ALL wands resolves damage − standing pool, pool UNCONSUMED, remainder = normal part+HP
   hit; the spec's own 6-vs-4 example asserted, full blunt asserted, melee contrast asserted).
4. ~~Magic-offhand hooks~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop, 334 tests: CharmMinionMult/TomeSpellMult on
   Body — best USABLE held piece, broken arm silences; tome multiplies INT-cast damage over
   base+robe [composition = balance knob], charm multiplies minion hits; away-from-zero rounding).
5. ~~Ranged slot + equip exclusions~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop, 336 tests): Body gains ONE ranged
   slot (bows/slings only — Wield rejects them as hand items); wand/staff in hand ↔ ranged slot
   mutually exclude both directions; the Charge/pierce verb family consults the RANGED slot
   (melee techniques keep the hand-config); bow needs BOTH arms usable, sling ONE, item stays
   assigned when unusable (§6e); kits/Gearing/shell route by kind (a sword+shield AND a bow
   coexist, per the Ranger). VISIBLE: the Ranger figure no longer draws its bow — §17 #22 locks
   "not drawn until a back-mount layer exists". Shield-object pairing rules still await the
   shield data (CON gate OPEN).
6. ~~Sling Charge path~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop, 335 tests: the sling rides the bow's exact
   pierce+Charge resolution via the DEX Primary consult — end-to-end asserted: 1 dmg through 5
   standing shields, pool untouched, one Charge spent; dmg placeholder stays FLAGGED §17 #9).
**CD payload updated (B9)** — roster relay for the B2 figure-art regen batch. **PROCESS CHANGE
(Doug, 2026-07-03; also in loop.md):** every NEW Needs-CD finding gets BOTH a STATUS line AND a
relay-ready item appended to `outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md` in the same pass — keeping that
outbox current is part of DONE.
_PROGRESS (2026-07-03 loop): ~~state-family render wiring~~ DONE (generic stateless-family
resolution, 8d85ef7); ~~GEAR click matrix + auto-displace~~ DONE (equipped→unequip,
equippable→equip; hands-full melee benches the OFF-hand [Hands[1] — Hands[0]=first-equipped=main
per §6d promotion], armor swaps via Gearing's existing displacement; LOCKED inert via the Body's
own wield gate; one GearTabItems composition shared by render + hit-test). Combat seal =
Expedition's Choosing-only gate. ~~paper-doll gear-state compose~~ DONE (00a87b6: disabled armor
renders BARE + un-ringed, broken arm never draws its weapon — Core-tested, 320).
~~§6c armor data~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop, 321 tests): Armor remodelled to (Id, Name, Slot, Line,
Tier) — LINE names the governing attribute (§6e sustain rides IT, not the slot; blessed-initial
threshold = line-capacity 0, §6c's "both arms break" example); `ArmorLines` ships all 10 canon
ladders (STR/DEX ×4 slots, INT chest+head — the CON SHIELD OBJECT is a hand-config item, DEFERRED
to the §6d wield build). Effects live: STR plate soaks the covered part's own damage (-2×tier,
never HP); DEX leather = GLOBAL evade, +2%×tier per worn sustained piece, with the §6 broken-leg
HARD ZERO; INT robe carries +2 spell damage per piece as data (COMBAT CONSUMER PENDING — next
slice, hooks Caster spell power w/ 2-piece cap). RETIRED: plate-as-worn-shield-source (§6b shield
sources are techniques + the future shield object) and the old bespoke Plate/Hide (Shops staples
now name rung-1 canon pieces; merchant armor price = 2×tier+2 placeholder). Weapons still FALL
OFF below threshold in Body.Damage — the §6e disable-not-drop change is its own slice, rides the
cascade answer. ~~robe spell-damage consumer~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop, 323
tests: Body.SpellDamageBonus = +2 per worn sustained robe piece, 2-piece cap; applied on INT-stat
Discharge HITS only — heals stay unbuffed; dies when INT collapses). ~~§6d arm-broken weapon lockout~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop,
326 tests: Body.HandUsable [hand 0 = dominant armR, hand 1 = armL; armless bodies don't gate];
Consulted() filters broken-arm hands so the weapon stays ASSIGNED but stops answering, whatever
stat it gates — player AND foe via the shared Body path; FigureBinding.HandUsable delegates, one
truth for render + combat). ~~weapons disable-not-drop~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop, 336 tests:
the Body.Damage fall-off is DELETED — a hand item below its reserve stays ASSIGNED, reads
DISABLED red on the card [HandItemUsable feeds InvCardState], stops answering Consulted, leaves
the paper-doll render, and re-activates by itself when the stat heals; asserted end to end incl.
the self-re-activation). REMAINING: cascade ranking
(BLOCKED on the sustain-model question below); drag-reorder; vestigial pre-run branch retire._
**‼ NEEDS HUMAN — cascade SUSTAIN MODEL ambiguous, blocking the ranking build:** §6e reads
"an attribute can't sustain EVERY equipped item" + a ranking with TIE-BREAKS + cheapest-first
recovery — all load-bearing only under a SUMMED shared-pool demand (level 5 vs two req-3 swords:
one disables). But §6d locks equip gating "purely by EACH weapon's OWN per-tier STR requirement"
(individual thresholds) — and under individual thresholds the disable set is trivially
{req > level}: ranking order never changes membership and ties are cosmetic. Doug: is gear
sustain (a) SUMMED against the attr pool alongside technique reservations (FTL-power-budget
style), or (b) individual thresholds (each item vs the post-reservation level)? The ranking's
Core tests assert economy math — not building it on a guess.

## ✅ BUILD-BREAKING BUG FIXED (2026-07-03, post-commit 57cc8a6): mgcb crashed on launch
`dotnet run` failed content build (MGCB exited -532462766 / 0xE0434352 — unhandled CLR exception,
not a normal build error). Root cause: the 57cc8a6 mgcb-mirror step wrote the 9 new entries
(8 technique icons + doom_stripe) into `Roguebane.Game/Content/Content.mgcb` (the copy the build
actually reads) with `\directive:` backslashes instead of MGCB's required `/directive:` — 81 lines,
that file only. The CD-source copy (`Roguebane.Content/Content.mgcb`) was fine. Fixed in place
(mechanical slash swap, no content change, verified by diff). **BUILD-VERIFIED (2026-07-03, loop):**
`dotnet build Roguebane.Game` green; all 9 new xnbs produced (technique icons + doom_stripe). If a
future drop mirrors mgcb entries again, verify the directive slash direction (`/`, not `\`) before commit.

## ✅ DROP APPLIED + COMMITTED (2026-07-03; applied by Cowork, committed 57cc8a6)
The `.drop/` staging is applied and deleted; the drop-commit first-pass directive is SATISFIED
(guards re-verified at commit: parse 6 screens, drop_audit 0 gaps, 313 tests green).
**What landed (all VERIFIED):** per-state chip labels (`states.<state>.label` — SELECT/LOCKED/
✓ CORE SET, CHOOSE/✓ CHOSEN); `core.badge` bound (engine adds the display datum: Grunt STARTER,
Warden BULWARK, Adept CASTER, Summoner/Reaver/Ranger SPECIALIST); **NEW SCHEMA `element.parts[]`**
(named value/label sub-parts with real fonts/px/margins on the loadout tiles + named chrome boxes);
`previewStage` panel (the purple figure backdrop); citymap gauge internals as real elements
(titles/counts/notes — retire the one-text-run stopgap header); `doomFillStripes` via NEW pattern
imageBind semantics (STATIC `ui/pattern/*` path = TILE the PNG across the element rect;
`ui/pattern/doom_stripe.png` shipped); skinned-button labels re-extracted (mono/7px/ground-dark);
uniform 94px resource chips (SUMMONS seats, nothing clips); `ShieldPool.count`+`ShieldPool.regenPct`
now in the manifest (wire the existing shell renders to them); 8 technique icons added
(bandage/block/cleave/drain/ember/jab/lunge/stoneskin — game mgcb MIRRORED, 558 entries, done by
Cowork); NewGame "1"/"2" step markers removed from headers (Doug's manual edit, intentional).
GUARDS RUN: layout.json parses (6 screens); `drop_audit.py` = 0 gaps, all screens clean; changed
refs (01/03/05) exactly 1920×1080; target_tag stays deleted.
**⚠ DROP REPAIR (flag, already done — do not redo):** the drop's layout.json had LOST
`screens.campaignmap` + `templates.cityNode` entirely (CD extraction miss; their audit claimed "04
untouched"). Cowork RESTORED both VERBATIM from the previous manifest (no invention; drop_audit
confirms the restored screen matches CampaignMap.dc.html: 9 els / 2 tpls). Logged to CD in the
payload — until CD's extractor includes campaignmap again, EVERY future drop must re-check the
key-set diff (screens/templates lost vs previous — add that diff to `drop_audit.py` as a standing
guard: it currently checks html→manifest, not manifest→previous-manifest).
**NEW ENGINE WORK from this drop (fold into the M1 newgame batch + adjacent screens; M0 STILL
FIRST):** ~~`element.parts[]` draw support~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop: `Element.Align/Parts` +
`ElementPart` in the schema model, fixture + quantified contract tests [315 green], renderer draws
each part's text run at its element-local rect w/ align + sample fallback and NEVER the element's
flattened sample — the M1 preview-tile stopgap is deleted, the manifest authors those tiles now);
~~gauge-header stopgap retire~~ DONE (same pass: `supplies`/`support` panel binds resolve null —
containers, chrome-only; NEW `supplies.count`/`support.count` resolver cases feed the drop's real
count elements; citymap binds hold 15). ~~per-state chip labels draw~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop:
`TemplatePart.States` parses + survives placement [316 tests]; selection chips draw per-state

extracted CHOSEN sample, inheriting it painted every card chosen (caught by fidelity: ng 76.2, fixed
back to 78.3 = baseline; the M1 CHOOSE/SELECT stopgap is retired; LOCKED state authored but no lock
model exists, never resolves). ~~pattern-tile imageBind~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop: `Element.ImageBind`

Badge on the record + roster values from the dc.html source — Grunt STARTER, Warden BULWARK, Adept
CASTER, Summoner/Reaver/Ranger SPECIALIST; `core.badge` resolver case). ~~shield count/regen
wires~~ DONE (same pass: header resolves "SHIELD" only, NEW `ShieldPool.count` carries n / m;
`ShieldPool.regenPct` is the fill ELEMENT — width = live progress across the track's inner width,
the track's inline progress draw retired; datum-fill suppression + BindResolves extended; encounter
binds 20→21). ~~verify resource-strip seating~~ DONE (2026-07-03 loop: encounter seats ALL FOUR —
203 = 4×47+3×5, SUMMONS visible on the gate shot; citymap/equipment still clip to 3 (197 authored,
212 needed at gap 8) — numbers logged Needs-CD B0). ~~LAYOUT_CONTRACT fold~~ DONE (same pass: §12
gains `element.parts[]`/`part`, `states.<state>.label` replace-wholesale semantics, pattern
`imageBind` static-path tiling). **DROP ENGINE QUEUE COMPLETE** — every 07-03 pm drop item landed.
Canon core-effect copy in `CoreRunes.cs` LANDED in M1 (see below).
**M1 previewFigure MISSING PARTS — FIXED (2026-07-03 loop):** root cause = bare-variant sprite
keys: only the grunt figures ship bare art; an unarmored body asked warden/ranger for
`*_barehealthy` → null texture → the null-texture BORDER BOX (Doug's empty limbs). Composer now
emits ORDERED FALLBACKS (bare → armored same-condition → armored healthy; Core-tested, 318) and
the shell resolves through them — only a figure missing its whole part row still boxes. PROBE
BUILT (M1 directive, rides SMOKE ASSETS): every figure × z-part × armored row must resolve
(`SMOKE FIGURES`) — first truth: 18 figures, armored-missing=0, 16 bare-less (fallback covers,
informational). Element-level imageBind joined the asset probe. Same compose path serves the
Equipment paper-doll + encounter foes, so those heal too. Doug: eyeball Warden/Elf-Ranger limbs
live to close the report.
**NEWGAME RE-JUDGE post-A3 (2026-07-03 loop):** geometry_diff findings 4→3, ALL CD-side
(coreCards container heuristic + coreHeader/raceCards FLATTENED 2-span extractions); previewStage
renders (A4's gradient fill landed, generic panel draw). NEW FIX: `preview.fig` on newgame drew
the RUN body during an in-run smoke (the drive's Summoner under Grunt card copy — the identity
mask class M0.3 killed, resurfacing via the figure). preview.fig now ALWAYS previews the BUILD;
`Body` keeps the live run body. ng fidelity 78.3→78.6. Preview figure wears bare limbs (unarmored
build body) vs the ref's armored+armed sample — live-state class; gear draws when wielded.
**M1 DETECTOR GAP — CLOSED (2026-07-03 loop):** the wrap clamp's silent drop is now RECORDED
(`RecordTextTruncation` at both clamp exits: mid-paragraph word drop + whole-paragraph drop);
`SMOKE TEXTGEOM` emits `truncated=N trunc=[el:'snippet']`; the gate fails ANY truncation — pinned
ZERO, absolute, no baseline ride (per M1: "label missing from every box cannot score 77+ again").
First measurement: truncated=0 on all six screens (the M1 batch left the build clean).
**EQUIPMENT WALK #1 (2026-07-03 loop) — drive aligned to ref per M0.3:** the whole 0%-element
cluster (currentCoreName/coreLabel/partLines/runeBag) was ONE cause: the encounter drive's
SUMMONER mid-fight state vs design/02's authored GRUNT "READY TO MARCH". Equipment now owns a
THIRD gate pass (`RB_SCREEN=loadout`): default grunt build, a1 cleared, Choosing, stash-seeded
dagger+plate equipped (the ref doll is armed). Summoner cycling stays for encounter/citymap
(design/01 IS the summoner). eq fidelity 74.7→74.9, currentCoreName cleared to ref.
**BASELINE HAND-EDIT (measurement change, logged per M0 rule 2):** equipment binds 22→21 — the
honest denominator under the ref-aligned drive (buildMinions legitimately empty: grunt fields no
minions, matching the ref). Justified by Doug's M0.3 line "ALIGN THE DRIVE TO THE REF STATE (pick
Grunt)"; no other baseline entry touched (the contested overflow re-pin still awaits approval).
Remaining eq 0% elements (coreLabel style, partLines, runeBagTitle) = next walk slice.
**EQUIPMENT WALK #2 (2026-07-03 loop):** the loadout drive now really CLEARS a1 (aim card 0 at
the foe + AUTO after Enter — an untargeted technique just holds; SetAuto alone was a stalemate) →
topbar reads the design's READY TO MARCH (run.state maps Choosing to that copy); `runes.budget`
resolves the authored "BUDGET n free / m" form. coreLabel logged Needs-CD B0b (one bind
`core.name` feeds two different authored copies — "Human Grunt" block vs "CORE GRUNT" chip; no
id hacks). Still-0% residue: partLines/runeBagTitle (figure-underlay + title-style class), next
slice.
**‼ GATE RED (pre-existing, DROP-caused — verified by stash/rerun at HEAD): text OVERFLOWS rose
ng 6→9, city 4→6.** Membership is the drop's NEW/re-authored elements (city: suppliesTitle/
supportTitle/castlePanelTitle/doomTitle; ng: header/preview family). Numerics: VERTICAL-only —
drawn line box h=14–15 vs authored 11px bands (display-font line spacing; INK fits, probes read
1.0–1.1×) — the same class as the already-baselined logo. Engine draw is per authored fontPx
(correct); shrinking to fit would break verified sizing. **NEEDS HUMAN (M0 rule 2: measurement
changes need approval BEFORE commit):** approve ONE of (a) baseline re-pin accepting the new
counts (textgeom ng 9/2, city 6/0) as drop-authored content, or (b) textgeom switching to INK
bboxes (matches probes; detector keeps catching clipped/missing text). 2026-07-03 late addendum: the evening CD drop adds equipment
`invTitle` to the same class (overflow 11→12) — fold into the same decision. Until then the gate
stays red on exactly these lines; fidelity/binds/coverage all green (city fidelity 86.5→87.0).
**PRIORITY ORDER post-drop (standing rule, CLAUDE.md §Working):** failing gates / measurement
integrity (M0) FIRST → drop-unblocked work (the list above + M1) → only then contingency/refactor.
A drop RESOLVING a blocker is authoritative here — don't re-verify what the re-arm block says
landed; spend the pass building on it.

## ✅ layout.json RESTORED (2026-07-01 pm) — the PNG-clobber is fixed by a clean re-drop
Valid JSON (5690 lines) carrying the newest CD work: `imageBind` (beaconNode → node icons as PNGs, incl.
skirmish, via `icons/node/{node.type}` — so "skirmish" isn't a literal), frame-v3 `repeat`+`centerFill`,
`cityNode`, the instrumentation. The BUILD GAP is CLOSED (2026-07-02): the three new icons are mirrored
into the GAME-side `Roguebane.Game/Content/Content.mgcb` (the one the build actually reads — CD's
`Roguebane.Content/Content.mgcb` copy is not wired; unify later) and skirmish renders on the map.

*Lean by design. SHIPPED-work history + rationale live in `git log` (detailed commits) and old STATUS
revisions (`git show <rev>:STATUS.md`) — recoverable, so not duplicated here. Locked design lives in
`design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`. This file = CURRENT state only. (Whittled 2026-07-01 from ~900 lines; nothing
current dropped.)*

## ✅ CD DROP LANDED (2026-07-03) — payload #11–18 delivered; REVIEWED (Cowork session), COMMITTED
Drop committed 2026-07-03 with the new drop-time guard: **`tools/drop_audit.py` BUILT (P0-A.7)** —
parses every `design/dchtml/*.dc.html` (data-el/-binds/-template/-tpl/-container/-bind-gate/-states/
-image-bind/-color-bind/-frames, text content, data-design÷2) and diffs that inventory against
layout.json; exit 1 on any extraction gap. First run: 6 screens audited, **2 real gaps found**
(encounter `ShieldPool.count` + `ShieldPool.regenPct` bound in html, absent from manifest — engine
already renders both; logged Needs-CD #4). Run it on every drop alongside the parse guard.
**GATE: GREEN (2026-07-03, post P0-C.2).** The post-drop 48-element BLANK class was the OLD z
convention overpainting them (equipment backdrop covered its whole screen) — the paint-ordinal
switch zeroed both the ELEM-BLANK and OCCLUDED classes; baselines re-pinned on the fixed render.
VERIFIED: all `design/NN` refs exactly **1920×1080** (#11);
targeting redesign complete in 01+08 (hotkey chips 1–6, number aim-tags w/ stacking, "no boxes ever
drawn", pulse assets `ui/reticle/focus_p0–p2` + AIMING=red cursor) (#12); merchant fits shelves w/ real
wareCard chrome + literal pager/LEAVE labels (#13); role chips per-core (#14); beginBtn/HELD labels ship
(#15); technique icons are imageBinds + `youAreHere`/doomTitle homed (#16); Elf blurb canon'd (#17);
**`design/dchtml/` landed (#18)** — all screens as .dc.html at native 1920×1080 with full extraction
markup (`data-el/-binds/-template/-container/-bind-gate/-states/-image-bind`, `sc-for`) + `proto/`
scripts + CD's own `DROP_AUDIT.md`; citymap homes ALL four ex-overlays (castlePanel+fortRows w/ per-part
states, campaignStrip, packChips, equipmentBtn); equipment gains backdrop + ✕ CLOSE; **z is now ONE
convention (paint ordinal, back→front; find the scene by its `*.scene` bind, not z==0)**; layout.json
structurally complete (9260 lines, new binds present — full parse = first loop guard).
**DROP GAPS:** (a)+(b)+(c)+(f) ~~mgcb mirror / target_tag delete / LAYOUT_CONTRACT fold / gitignore~~
ALL DONE (2026-07-03 — see P0-C.1); (d) ~~v4 frames 1:1~~ DONE (P0-C.3);
(e) `reference/screens/` never arrived (CD-side only — fine).

## ⇒ NEW LOCKS (2026-07-03 pm, Doug): core-effect roster = CANON (adopted from design/05 v2 → SPEC §5:
Called Shot renames Piercing Focus; copy may describe unbuilt mechanics until the effect-model pass —
flagged, acceptable; Summoner's stays the only BUILT effect). STAT BLOCKS in design/05 v2 are NOT
adopted — Doug wants a LIVE TUNING session; until then the roster keeps build values and the fidelity
diff MASKS stat-digit regions (tolerated placeholder zones). §13 ASPECT-FILL: BUILD IT (the old
letterbox scope-confirm is resolved — bg scale-to-cover, HUD anchored to real edges, no bars).
MERCHANT receiving LOCKED (§12): ALL wares click-to-buy tiles; technique→palette, minion→minion
inventory, rune→rune bag; slotting stays Equipment's; techniques/minions/runes become BUYABLE.

## ‼‼ HUMAN DIRECTIVES — 2026-07-03 LATE (COURSE-CORRECTION; WINS over everything below.
## Doug reviewed the live build vs design/05: newgame is visibly wrong yet marked "at floor".)

**M0 — MEASUREMENT INTEGRITY (the ruler got bent; fix it BEFORE any more fidelity passes):**
_M0.1–3 DONE (2026-07-03 late, same pass the directive landed): blur scoring REVERTED → unblurred
alignment search (±3px, shift REPORTED as a number in the ranked list); the illegal identity mask
DELETED; the newgame smoke now cycles the build to the ref's GRUNT state for its shot and restores
after (drive aligned, not masked). M0.5 DONE same day: SMOKE ASSETS probes every
authored image/imageBind path against the real content build (placeholders enumerate their domains;
unknown placeholders report unverifiable, never skip silent) — first run found the race.headImage
class exactly as Doug called it: `race.id` had NO ResolveBind case, so the head imageBind resolved
to an empty path and died silently. Fixed (+ part-image path normalize); HEADS NOW BLIT on both
race cards (eyeballed). Current probe truth: 6 technique icons missing (bandage/cleave/drain/ember/
jab/lunge — real Needs-CD), 2 placeholders unverifiable (legend.type/lot.id — domains to add).
M0.4 DONE same day: the smoke emits a
textgeom sidecar (element, drawn bbox, string, font family per text draw) and
`tools/geometry_diff.py <dc.html> <rects> <textgeom>` prints the numeric per-element table —
authored(source/2) vs manifest vs drawn: pos/size deltas, fontPx, family, string, span-FLATTENED
detection. First newgame table (9 findings) CONFIRMS Doug's list numerically: the four preview
tiles draw the VALUE only vs the authored value+label spans; coreHeader/raceCards/raceHeader flag
FLATTENED; all measured fontPx match. (beginBtn shows NO-TEXT-DRAWN — a recording gap: the styled
button draws via TextPx directly, not through the recorded path; extend recording with the M1 pass.)
Newgame floor claim stays REVOKED until the M1 re-walk._
1. **REVERT the blur-tolerant element scoring (4b6a705).** The 1.5px Gaussian before element scoring
   makes the tool blind to ±2–3 design-px errors — EXACTLY the current bug class (padding/margins/
   label offsets Doug can see by eye). Replace with an **ALIGNMENT SEARCH**: score each element crop
   at integer shifts within ±3px, take the best, and REPORT THE SHIFT as a position delta in the
   ranked list (a real offset becomes a NUMBER to fix, not noise to tolerate). AA tolerance comes
   from the alignment, not from blurring; if residual AA noise still floors small text, cap any
   smoothing at 0.5px AND print both blurred/unblurred scores. NEVER let a smoothed score be the
   one a "done/floor" claim cites.
2. **RULE (also added to loop.md): never modify the MEASUREMENT to improve a score.** Any change to
   scoring/masks/thresholds/drives that RAISES numbers requires a STATUS-logged human approval line
   BEFORE commit. Fix the render, not the ruler.
3. **MASK AUDIT:** the ONLY Doug-approved mask is the newgame stat-digit zones (tuning session
   pending). The b61bbb7 identity-block mask (previewName/Role/CoreEffect*) is ILLEGAL — the drive
   picked Summoner while the ref shows Grunt: **ALIGN THE DRIVE TO THE REF STATE** (pick Grunt) and
   DELETE that mask. Sweep for other unapproved masks.
4. **GEOMETRY DIFF (the real fix for text layout, immune to AA):** the smoke sidecar already carries
   rect/fontPx/borderW — extend it with each element's DRAWN TEXT BBOX + the string drawn; build
   `tools/geometry_diff.py` comparing per element against the dc.html AUTHORED geometry (box, font
   family+px, casing, alignment, sibling spacing — parse the source spans like drop_audit does).
   Output a NUMERIC per-element table: pos-delta, size-delta, font mismatch, missing-string. Pixels
   judge ART; geometry judges LAYOUT. Gate on geometry-clean before any screen is called done.
5. **ASSET-EXISTS PROBE:** every `imageBind`/static image path in manifest + dc.html must resolve to
   a GAME-mgcb texture; unresolved paths print per screen. FINDING to reverse: b61bbb7 tagged
   raceCards low score "Needs-CD head sprites" — WRONG: `sprites/body/human_grunt/head_healthy.png`
   EXISTS and the manifest authors `race.headImage` imageBind; the ENGINE isn't blitting it. Un-tag
   Needs-CD, fix the resolve. (This is the "missing assets not detected" class Doug called out.)
6. **NEWGAME "at floor" is REVOKED.** After M0.1–5, re-walk newgame with unblurred scores + the
   geometry table; the M1 list below is the starting bug set (visible by eye today).

**M1 — NEWGAME REAL BUGS (Doug's eyeball + manifest facts, 2026-07-03 late):**
- Canon core-effect COPY never landed in data: `CoreRunes.cs` still ships "Piercing Focus" + the old
  descs — update CoreEffectName/Desc to the §5 CANON roster (pure data, quick; also shrinks the
  drive-vs-ref content divergence class).
- `race.headImage` imageBind unresolved (M0.5) — heads render as empty boxes.
- TILE value+label layout broken on all three columns — and in the LOADOUT column the labels are
  MISSING OUTRIGHT: every box (STR/INT/DEX/CON, BASE HP, RUNE BUDGET, ACTIONS, MINION BAYS) renders
  a bare corner number and nothing else (Doug, 2026-07-03 late). Mechanism: dc.html authors VALUE
  (mono, larger) over LABEL (mono 8.5px, +4px margin) as separate spans; the manifest flattened the
  tile to ONE text ("20 RUNE BUDGET") and the engine draws that run at one size in the DISPLAY face
  (serif "1" reads as "I") — it overflows the tile and everything past the value CLIPS AWAY. Engine
  meanwhile: split value/label from the flattened run ('\n'-aware path), render MONO per source,
  centred, label under value. Manifest fix queued (payload A3, proper two-part tiles). Same class on
  core-card BUDGET/ACTIONS/BAYS + race-card stat boxes (labels clip under values).
  **DETECTOR GAP this exposes: a drawn string whose visible portion ≠ the full string (truncated /
  clipped outside its rect) must FAIL the collision/overflow detector — "label missing from every
  box on the screen" cannot score 77+ again.**
- STATE CHIPS missing: unchosen race shows no CHOOSE chip; unchosen cores show no SELECT/LOCKED
  button (dc.html computes selLabel per state; extraction only captured the chosen sample —
  payload addendum). Shell-side flagged stopgap OK meanwhile (input already exists).
- roleChip stamps "STARTER" on all six cores — bindless sample in the manifest (BULWARK/CASTER/
  SPECIALIST appear ZERO times in layout.json; the PNG shows them but extraction dropped the datum).
  Payload addendum: bind `core.badge`. Engine: add the display datum when it lands.
- previewFigure's purple backdrop panel doesn't draw (design/05 shows it; check the element's fill).
- **previewFigure MISSING PARTS per core (Doug, 2026-07-03 late):** Warden renders EMPTY OUTLINE
  BOXES for arms+legs; Elf Ranger likewise (partial). NOT an art gap — `sprites/body/human_warden/`
  has all 21 part PNGs, the game mgcb lists them (84 entries), the figure def is in layout.json.
  It's an engine part-resolve/compose failure for non-grunt figures (state-key or part-name lookup
  misses → the slot rect draws as an outline box, which the paint-coverage gate counts as painted —
  invisible to it). BUILD THE PROBE with M0.5: for EVERY figure def, attempt-resolve every z-list
  part texture at every state, headless; report failures per figure. Then fix the lookup. Check the
  same failure on the Equipment paper-doll + encounter figures (same compose path).
- CORE EFFECT block spacing (eyebrow/name/desc run together, desc to card edge) — geometry-diff
  will quantify; fix paddings per source.
**Fix M1 as ONE batched newgame pass (same-class items share causes), verified by the M0 tools.**
_M1 BATCH LANDED (2026-07-03 late): canon §5 core-effect copy in CoreRunes.cs (all six, Called Shot
renamed); preview tiles draw VALUE-over-LABEL mono centred per source (geometry STRING findings
gone); unchosen cards wear FLAGGED-stopgap CHOOSE/SELECT chips (dim border, muted label — per-state
labels remain payload A2); styled/skinned button labels now RECORD textgeom (beginBtn
NO-TEXT-DRAWN cleared). geometry_diff newgame findings 9→4; the rest are CD-side: 3 FLATTENED
span flags (A3) + the coreCards container heuristic. previewFigure backdrop CONFIRMED an
extraction gap (element fill=null in layout.json — A4 stands). roleChip awaits the core.badge
bind (A1). Core-effect block spacing: geometry shows ≤3px shifts — re-judge after the A3 tile
re-extraction lands._

**M2 — WORKLOAD BATCHING (Doug: more per pass):** a fidelity pass = one SCREEN, but fix the WHOLE
ranked geometry-diff table for that screen in the pass — same-class deltas (font/pad/label) share a
cause; batch them, one commit. The gate prints the ranked list + geometry table at pass END so the
NEXT pass starts with a plan instead of re-discovery.

**M3 — BASELINE RATCHET PLAN (the path to baselines that mean something):** (1) NO re-pin until M0
lands — pinning now freezes the lies. (2) After M0: ONE `--update` — scores will DROP (newgame's
78.7 was blur+mask-flattered); that pin is the first honest floor. (3) Each batched screen pass ends
with `--update` — the baseline only climbs. (4) Once M1 lands, overflow/collision baselines flip
from "may not rise" to **pinned ZERO, absolute** — the grandfathering that let loadout clipping pass
is abolished; masks shrink to the stat digits only (dies at the tuning session). (5) A screen
graduates from regression-floor to ABSOLUTE bar when geometry-diff is clean: done = geometry clean +
UNBLURRED fidelity ≥ the agreed threshold + every residual enumerated and tagged CD/art/state.

## ⇒ HUMAN DIRECTIVES — 2026-07-03 (P0 — do this block TOP-DOWN before anything else)

**‼ P0-A — PIXEL-TRUTH SYSTEM (root cause found: measurement itself was broken; build FIRST — it
multiplies every later pass):** every `design/NN-*.png` is **924×540** but design space is **960×540**
(aspect 1.711 vs 1.778), and `fidelity_diff.py` LANCZOS-stretches BOTH images to 960×540 — so every
score ever taken compared against a reference warped ~4% horizontally (≈18 px mid-screen), with the
live window's letterbox bars (2560×1528 client = 1.675) baked into the shot, all at a 1× 540p working
res where border weight + text metrics are unmeasurable. Prior "walked clean / zero renderer deltas"
claims were made against warped refs — treat them as UNVERIFIED; re-walk with v2. Build, in order:
1. **Reference contract + guard — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** `ui_gate.py` step 0 hard-fails any
   `design/NN-*.png` screen ref not exactly 960K×540K (`00-assets-*` sheets exempt — not screens).
   Baseline re-pin still WAITS on v2 (step 3) + the newgame stat-digit MASK (fold into v2's
   per-element crops — see NEW LOCKS).
2. **Render-at-reference-resolution — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** `RB_SIZE=WxH` pins the backbuffer
   (scene aspect-fits to exact ref res, shots save the scene = no letterbox/chrome); the gate runs
   all smokes at `RB_SIZE=1920x1080`; `fidelity_diff` now compares SAME-SIZE pairs 1:1 (zero
   resample, mode-tagged in output; mismatched sizes keep the legacy 960×540 fallback). First 1:1
   numbers (informational, not pinned): enc 80.5 eq 80.4 city 84.7 camp 94.7 ng 77.5 mer 83.0.
3. **fidelity_diff v2 — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** the smoke emits a rects SIDECAR per shot (every
   element's resolved design rect via ScreenLayout — no anchor math duplicated tool-side);
   `--elements` scores each element's crop → RANKED worst-first list (id, score, design rect);
   `--mask` neutralizes tolerated placeholder zones (newgame stat tiles/rows masked in the gate —
   race/core-card digits live INSIDE templates, accepted depression until per-part masking is
   warranted). Tile grid stays as the whole-frame score + heatmap visual. **BASELINES RE-PINNED**
   on v2 numbers (1:1 + mask): binds enc 16 eq 22 camp 4 ng 12 city 9 mer 10; fidelity enc 80.5
   eq 80.4 city 84.7 camp 94.7 ng 78.1 mer 83.0. The dead-baseline warning is CLEARED.
4. **Numeric probes — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** `tools/probes.py <shot> <rects.sidecar>` measures the
   SHOT's pixels vs the manifest numbers: TEXT-HEIGHT (ink bbox in each text element ÷ authored
   fontPx; skinned/image elements excluded via sidecar-v2 flags) + BORDER-STROKE (edge-midpoint ink
   run vs authored w). FIRST NUMBERS: borders ALL 1.00× (the BorderPx fix verified by measurement);
   labels 1.0–1.1×; worst text 1.4× (part labels — serif ascender span vs fontPx), multi-line descs
   read as line-count multiples (probe caveat). **Doug's "1.5–2× oversized" is NOT present in the
   current build's numbers** — if it still LOOKS big live, re-shot through the probe (stale-build
   suspicion, same as the 07-02 font case). Standalone tool; run on gate shots ad hoc.
5. **Collision/overflow detector — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** the smoke's full render records every
   drawn text footprint (element-owned); `SMOKE TEXTGEOM` reports per screen OVERFLOW (bbox outside
   its element rect ±2px) and COLLIDE (footprints of two non-nesting elements intersect); the gate
   BASELINES both counts and fails any RISE. First measurement (baselined): overflows enc 11 eq 10
   city 4 camp 2 ng 6 mer 7-10; collisions eq 3 camp 1 ng 2 — catching the known family
   (heroShield=SHIELD-over-bar, currentCoreName×currentCoreRole=doubled identity, eyebrow×title).
   Walk the lists down as slices; counts may only fall. FIRST BURN-DOWN (same day): the doubled
   identity text DIED ("core" block resolves null — the panel header was printing the name a 2nd
   time; eq binds 23→22, correct) and SHIELD-over-bar DIED (bound-panel headers now confine to the
   band ABOVE their contained children + height-fit their font; enc overflows 11→9, heroShield/
   foeHp clean). Both were Doug's live-screenshot bugs (P0-C.10 items 4+5).
6. **Hand-shot normalizer — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** `tools/normalize_shot.py <shot> [--trim-top N]
   [--client x,y,w,h] [--design ref.png]` — auto-trims uniform margins to the client rect (an OS
   title bar needs --trim-top; a warning fires on non-16:9 clients since §13 pins HUD to real
   edges), rescales to 1920×1080, optionally chains fidelity_diff. ROUND-TRIP VALIDATED: a
   synthesized window shot (scene scaled to 2560×1440 + title bar + desktop margin) recovers the
   client exactly and scores 77.7 vs the gate's own 77.8 on the same build. **P0-A IS COMPLETE.**
7. **DROP AUDIT — ✅ BUILT (2026-07-03):** `tools/drop_audit.py` parses each screen's dc.html and
   diffs its inventory against `layout.json`; exit 1 on gaps. First run caught 2 (ShieldPool.count/
   regenPct — Needs-CD #4). dc.html stays READ-ONLY CD source (never edit/"fix" it; PNG refs stay
   the pixel bar). Run on every drop alongside the parse guard. Optional backstop still open:
   pinned headless capture at 960K×540K.
Wire ALL of it into `tools/ui_gate.py` (stays the ONE command); run every pass per loop.md.

**‼ P0-B — TARGETING build [design LANDED (01+08 v2); DESIGN_SPEC §8] — CORE DONE (2026-07-03):**
- ~~boxes~~ DELETED: whole-foe hover border, hovered-part border, band strips, no-frame fallback box
  — zero box affordances (band strips remain the CLICK hit-test, undrawn).
- ~~Cursor is reticle~~ DONE: OS cursor hides while a technique targets (IsMouseVisible in Update);
  red `aiming` rides the cursor, centring on the hovered limb band; right-click cancel already wired.
- ~~Locked mount~~ DONE: manifest `frames` (Element.Frames parses, schema-tested) cycle focus_p0→p1→p2
  on the fixed `_animTick` (render-only counter); size = part-rect larger side ×1.5 clamped 64–136
  scene px; while ANOTHER module is picking, kept targets draw the faint SECONDARY (0.55 alpha).
  Static foeReticle element gates off (bound icons suppress when their bind is unresolved — its
  authored image is a mock-position stand-in; the mock box is gone from the shot, eyeballed).
- ~~AIM TAG stack~~ DONE (2026-07-03): aims group per part; each part's reticle wears a centred tag
  ROW above it — one `templates.aimTag` chip per kept module, reading its HOTKEY number (eyeballed:
  "1" above the locked head). Static foeAimTags element stays gated (mock position).
- ~~hotkey chips~~ DONE (2026-07-03): `technique.hotkey`/`bay.hotkey` parts resolve positionally —
  techniques 1..T then bays T+1.. (the D1–D6 order); eyeballed 1–4 on the castle drive's cards.
- **P0-B residual:** pulse cycling + hidden cursor are Update-side — verify LIVE (headless smoke is
  single-frame); bay-lane keys beyond techniques don't PRESS yet (chips number them; input still
  technique-only — wire when bay pressing is designed). Flag any repro to the targeting-FSM debt line.

**‼ P0-C — POST-DROP ENGINE QUEUE (the 07-03 walk's CD-tagged items LANDED in the drop; what remains
is ALL engine-side). Fix with P0-A numbers (before/after per-element scores):**
1. ~~Drop wiring, mechanical~~ **✅ DONE (2026-07-03):** parse guard = drop_audit + contract tests
   (P0-A.7); game mgcb mirrors focus_p0/p1/p2 (asset probe pins them, 14/14), target_tag entry +
   PNG deleted (CD's mgcb was already clean; zero code refs); scratch .gitignore predated the drop;
   DROP_AUDIT schema notes folded into LAYOUT_CONTRACT §11 (ref-export contract) + NEW §12
   (z=paint-ordinal, frames animation, bind-gate, data-part, item.pad); CLAUDE.md line arrived
   WITH the drop.
2. ~~z paint-ordinal switch~~ **✅ DONE (2026-07-03) — GATE WENT GREEN.** Renderer draws ascending z
   (one convention); scene layer found by `*.scene` bind (`IsSceneElement`); smoke leave-one-out +
   backdrop baseline follow the bind, not z==0. BIG un-break: the old descending order painted
   equipment's `backdrop` (z=1) over nearly the whole screen — ALL 48 ELEM-BLANK elements and ALL 6
   OCCLUDED elements were overpaint casualties, and both classes went to ZERO with the switch
   (beginBtn/heldBadge/titles/buttons all render now; attrPool divider un-broke as predicted).
   Fidelity re-pinned (enc 77.7 eq 76.5 city 85.3 camp 94.7 ng 77.0 mer 82.0) — enc/eq DIPPED vs
   the pre-switch pins because those pins scored backdrop-covered blanks whose dark fill
   coincidentally matched the ref (metric artifact, visually verified: full content now renders).
3. ~~v4 frames 1:1~~ **✅ DONE (2026-07-03):** `DrawFrameTex` scales by `1/SS` (not the fixed
   `1/ChromeBake`) — border-image-width == slice in SCENE px at ANY scene scale (identical at SS=2,
   native-crisp above); NineSlice tile STEPS now carry dstCornerScale too so edges tile at scaled
   native density (Core-tested, 305). Button skins verified: still ChromeBake=2 art (unchanged in
   the drop), their path keeps 1/ChromeBake.
4. **New template families:** ~~heroHpPip/foeHpPip~~ DONE (2026-07-03: segmented HP strips live —
   one point.live pip per max-HP point through the shieldPip leaf path, + hpLabel eyebrows
   ("HUMAN SUMMONER - HP", foe id + n/m; ASCII dash, font lacks U+00B7); encounter binds 16→20);
   ~~poolPip/attrPip/supplyPip/supportPip/healPip~~ DONE (2026-07-03: leaf templates carry
   `imageBind` — textured `ui/pip/*` PNGs replace fill chrome; template parts carry a NESTED
   `list` (PlacedPart.List) so poolRow/attrBar stamp per-stat full/reserved cells from the row
   datum; supplies.points/support.points resolve live [city binds 12]; healPips rides
   Body.hp.points; eyeballed: design/01 pool strips exact); ~~`data-bind-gate`~~ DONE
   (2026-07-03: content+binds = literal gated by the bind, WHOLE element suppresses on a closed gate
   — heldBadge only shows paused; nav.close/nav.equipment/begin resolver gates added, binds eq 23
   city 10 ng 13; smoke classifies gated literals as legit-silent); ~~`item.pad`~~ DONE (2026-07-03:
   [T,R,B,L] container inner padding in ListLayout, Core-tested 306 — citymap legend + equipment
   invTabs consume it); `frames` animation cycling (fixed tick) — OPEN, with the P0-B reticle.
5. **New binds resolve live:** ~~technique.hotkey/bay.hotkey~~ ~~targeting.tags~~ ~~Body.hp.points/
   hpLabel + foe.hp.points~~ ~~pool.attr.cells/attrs.cells~~ ~~supplies.points/support.points~~
   ~~Body.gear rows~~ (packChips live: Dagger/Plate chips + stat swatches, city binds 13)
   ~~nav.equipment/nav.close~~ ~~icons/technique/{id} + {loadout.id} imageBinds~~ (Brace blits its
   PNG; missing icon ids fall back to the tinted tile, logged Needs-CD #4) — ALL DONE 2026-07-03.
   ~~map.current~~ ("YOU ARE HERE"; U+25BC not in font) ~~campaign.cities/city.status~~ (spineCity
   chips taken/current/future via template ROOT chrome + states — a parts-template now styles its
   own cell; pickerCard family follows the chosen index: selected=amber ring, idle=dim, which also
   landed the race/core card chrome) ~~city.castle.parts~~ (fortRows read the castle foe's parts +
   INTACT/DAMAGED/BROKEN from live contributions — rows exist only while the castle encounter is
   live; NO persistent fort-damage model invented, §17 open) — DONE 2026-07-03, city binds 15–16/17.
   REMAINING: castlePanel container (resolves when its own datum model lands); scene backdrops
   verify (equipment's renders).
6. **P0-B targeting build** (block above).
7. ~~Merchant buys complete~~ **✅ DONE (2026-07-03, per the click-to-buy LOCK):** Stash gains
   Techniques/Minions/Marks inventories; `BuyTechnique/BuyMinion/BuyMark` mirror the gear buys
   (placeholder prices flagged to the economy tune); ALL five ware categories show price + BUY and
   click-to-buy dispatches by item type; bought techniques/minions join the Equipment tabs' pools
   (slotting stays Equipment's). Core-tested end-to-end (312: buy per category on deterministic
   stocking nodes + broke rejection). BONUS un-break: ListLayout linear flows now CLIP overflowing
   cells (26 HP pips were spilling out of healPips' 12-pip strip across the shelves) — merchant
   fidelity 81.6→82.7. NEEDS-HUMAN (new): how the RUNE BAG displays/uses a BOUGHT Mark — the bag
   renders ladder groups (climb-by-budget); a purchased Mark sits in Stash.Marks with no display
   home yet. Decide: bought rung auto-owns? shows as a bag row? (§17 rune taxonomy adjacent).
8. ~~§13 aspect-fill~~ **✅ DONE (2026-07-03):** scene target = the FULL backbuffer (blit 1:1 at
   origin, letterbox clear gone); design space EXTENDS on the loose axis (`ManifestUi.DesignW/H`,
   set on resize) so anchors pin to REAL window edges; `*.scene` backdrops SCALE-TO-COVER the
   extended space (source-cropped to the viewport aspect, nothing stretches). 16:9 resolves to the
   authored 960×540 exactly (gate byte-stable); verified 1600×1000 eyeball: zero bars, full-width
   status strip, buttons at true top-right, footer at true bottom. Legacy fixed-coord overlays
   (cleared/lost) still center on 960×540 — cosmetic on exotic aspects, noted.
9. **Legacy deletions — citymap HALF DONE (2026-07-03):** DrawSpine/DrawCastlePanel/DrawGearBar/
   EQUIPMENT[E] button + PackChipRect/PackItem/PackCount/EquipOpenRect DELETED — the manifest
   ex-overlays render live and INPUT rides their geometry (equipmentBtn click via nav.equipment;
   pack click-to-equip via the packChips cells, wielded chips no-op). Game1.CityMap.cs 119→33
   lines. ~~encounter card chrome~~ DONE (2026-07-03): techCards wear the actionCard state family —
   the frame reads the live FSM (targeting=str pulse-color, held=gold, ready=good, cooldown=dim,
   DRY/unpowered=locked); the mock damage-highlight digit (`technique.amount`, positioned for the
   mock's wrap) resolves EMPTY (the live description carries {power}); `technique.attr` resolves
   live (Ember reads INT, not the STR sample). **THE WHOLE P0 QUEUE (A/B/C) IS COMPLETE.**
10. **Engine-bug residue from the 07-03 walk:** ~~RUNE BAG regression~~ FIXED (2026-07-03: the drop
   restructured runeGroup into a bound header [runeGroups.type → live PATH name; taxonomy stays
   OPEN §17] + a NESTED runeCard list [g.runes] — the engine still ran the old flat-row path.
   Nested stamping wired through RuneRow/RuneBind; eyeballed: VESSEL/RESONANCE groups with rung
   names, effect lines, EQUIPPABLE/LOCKED state colors, discounted costs. One new minor overflow
   from live text on tight authored rects rode the fix — baselined);
   ~~doubled identity~~ ~~SHIELD label-over-bar~~ FIXED (see P0-A.5 burn-down);
   ~~CASTLE FORTIFICATIONS run-on~~ RETIRED (fortRows live);
   ~~node label oversize + chart's doubled "you are here"~~ FIXED (2026-07-03: hand label deleted —
   the youAreHere ELEMENT carries it; option labels draw at the design's 5.5px caption size instead
   of base-size Text; ring tightened to +2. citymap 85.5→86.3);
   ~~resource-strip~~ MEASURED: the region (~197px) can't seat 4 authored chips — engine clips
   (SUMMONS drops on encounter), extents logged Needs-CD #5. RESIDUE COMPLETE — remaining overflow
   burn-down items are the measured logo/title-width class (CD-authored tight rects, baselined).
**⇒ P0 QUEUE COMPLETE (2026-07-03, ~20 loop passes):** A.1–7 (pixel-truth system), B (targeting),
C.1–10 (drop wiring → z → frames → templates/binds → merchant buys → aspect-fill → legacy deletions
→ residue). Gate green. NEXT ARC: per-screen pixel-walks toward the design bar using the new
tooling (ranked per-element lists + probes + overflow burn-down), and the parked Needs-human/
Needs-CD items as they unblock.

## ✅ CD DROP LANDED (2026-07-02 pm) — verified + committed
layout.json (+4786 lines, parses, all 5 smokes green): NEW `merchant` screen; `states` (button skin
families + template state styles), `border.sides` (per-side borders), `colorBind` (element + part),
`shieldPip` self-styled leaf template (pips + state styles); `apex*` binds GONE from the manifest (the
rename completed CD-side). Assets: `icons/resource/summons.png` (the missing Summons icon),
`bg/merchant_stall.png` — both mirrored into the GAME-side mgcb. Designs: refreshed 01–05, NEW
`design/07-merchant.png` + `design/08-reticle-mounts.png` (the how-it-mounts reference). Core schema
model + contract tests updated (self-styled leaf templates + static imageBind paths are legal).
ENGINE TODO (unblocked, in order): ~~`states` draw~~ DONE (button-family skins nine-slice under the
label; disabled/on/down/hover/normal picked by bind + pointer; route-style states on chart/cityGraph are
style HINTS the graph drawers already cover semantically — revisit only on pixel-compare; merchant
buttons light up with the consumer), ~~`border.sides` draw~~ DONE (element + template-part
borders honour named edges + manifest width; contract test pins side names), ~~`colorBind` resolve~~
DONE (part fills tint from the bound datum's stat — technique/loadout/inv/bay — and element borders
take a core accent; `CoreRune.Accent` is the data hook, per-core VALUES await design [Needs-human];
ware.* resolves with the merchant consumer), ~~shield-pip instancing + regen fill~~ DONE (variable-N
pips via the self-styled shieldPip leaf template, live/spent states, SHIELD n/m header, regen track
fills toward the next pip from Body.ShieldRegenProgress — Core-tested; dashed spent-borders draw solid
pending the pixel pass), ~~summons icon~~ DONE, merchant-screen consumer PART 1 DONE (2026-07-02):
the design/07 stall renders FROM THE MANIFEST at merchant nodes — arrival opens it, LEAVE/Esc returns to
the map; stall backdrop via the new *.scene handler; heal offers + provision lots are live-priced list
rows with row-click + keyboard buys; run.resources strip is manifest data; PURSE readout. Part 2 DONE
(2026-07-02): WARES shelves render (nested wareCard stamping inside each shopSection's region, geometry
shared with the click hit-test), pager pages 3 sections at a time, weapons/armor BUY off the shelf into
the stash (techniques/minions/runes display un-buyable — receiving models stay design-open; their tag/
buy slots suppress rather than show mock samples), and the CITYMAP MERCHANT POPOVER STOPGAP IS RETIRED
(H re-opens the stall on the node). The whole engine-TODO queue from the 07-02 drop is now CLEAR —
remaining merchant work is design-gated (ware pricing/rarity models, pixel-compare vs design/07).

## ⇒ HUMAN DIRECTIVES — 2026-07-02 (revisions WIN; fold into the render arc / after the current slice)

**‼ P0 (2026-07-02 pm) — regressions/bugs first:**
- ~~COMBAT SCREEN REGRESSION~~ **FIXED (2026-07-02):** root cause = the CD drop authors full-screen
  `*.scene` backdrops at **z=0 meaning BACKMOST**, but the renderer's depth ordering (high z first)
  painted z=0 LAST — the backdrop covered every element on encounter/merchant/campaignmap (all three
  z=0-backdrop screens were blank; merchant/campaignmap had silently regressed too). Fix: z=0 draws
  as the scene layer behind everything; depth ordering unchanged above it. GUARD BUILT: `RB_SMOKE=1
  RB_MF=all` renders EVERY manifest screen headless, diffs each against its backdrop-only baseline,
  prints per-screen painted-% and **exits non-zero if any screen is backdrop-blank** (asset probes
  couldn't see this — the blank build reported probes 13/13). Run it every pass. All 6 screens
  currently paint 8.8–74.5%. NOTE Needs-CD: manifest z now mixes two conventions (z=0 backmost vs
  depth-descending panels z=6 over leaf z=1) — normalize in a future drop; renderer handles both.
- ~~SAMPLE-over-LIVE text bug~~ **FIXED (2026-07-02):** not the fallback logic (`?? sample` was already
  fallback-only) — the resolver mapped `core.coreEffect`/`preview.coreEffect` (the bordered BLOCK
  containers; label/name/desc are their own elements/parts) to CoreEffectDesc, painting the desc a
  SECOND time across the block. Blocks now resolve to nothing (chrome + sample eyebrow only). Bonus:
  the Equipment identity block's `core.role`/`core.coreEffectName`/`core.coreEffectDesc` screen binds
  never got resolver mappings (elements landed in the 07-02 CD drop) — mapped to the build's core
  (fixed for the run), so design/02's bottom-left block reads live. Verified RB_MF=all + eyeball:
  no doubled copy on NewGame cards or Equipment; identity block live. Residual bindless mock text
  ("gear 4" rows on Equipment = coreStats block extraction gap) tracked in Needs-CD.
- ~~FONT SWAP~~ **DONE (2026-07-02):** IM Fell English Regular (display) + JetBrains Mono Regular (mono)
  BUNDLED — TTFs from the official google/fonts + JetBrains repos (OFL texts alongside) live in
  `Roguebane.Content/fonts/` (CD source of truth) mirrored to `Roguebane.Game/Content/fonts/` (what the
  build reads); both `.spritefont`s point at the TTF paths (char regions were already widened ①②③✓✚◉).
  Content build green, RB_MF=all green, ✓ chips render real glyphs, card copy reads in the design serif.
  Georgia/Consolas gone. (Old "awaits download approval" gate: superseded by this P0's "do it now".)
- ~~RENDER AT NATIVE RES~~ **DONE (2026-07-02):** the scene RenderTarget is now sized to the NATIVE
  backbuffer aspect-fit every frame (recreated on fullscreen/resize; `EnsureSceneMatchesBackbuffer`)
  and blits 1:1 — the fixed 1080 cap + soft upscale are gone. `SS` became the float design→scene scale;
  the two densities it conflated are split out: `FontBake=3` (SpriteFonts rebuilt at 3x design px —
  display 60 / mono 42 — so text stays a DOWNSCALE up to ~1620p-class scenes) and `ChromeBake=2` (the
  2x-painted button/frame skins; nine-slice corners keep their shipped proportion). Border weights
  pinned to the shipped look (`BorderPx`: authored w=1 → 2 design px) independent of scene scale.
  Verified RB_MF=all at a 1600×900 backbuffer → 1600×900 shots, all screens paint, layout identical.
  Pixel-art figures still scale through the common path (nearest-neighbor via PointClamp).
- ~~LETTERBOX vs §13 aspect-fill~~ **SCOPE CONFIRMED (Doug 2026-07-03): BUILD §13 fill** — folded into
  the P0-C queue (#8). Bars die; bg scale-to-cover; HUD anchors to real edges.
- **RENDER-ACCURACY FLOOR (drive this BEFORE ever claiming "starved"):** a LOT matches the design better
  WITHOUT CD or systems — PURGE the outdated box/frame TEXTURE (old chrome still in use); apply the
  manifest v3 frames/chrome to every panel; fix the box treatments. Stream-1 fidelity isn't at its floor
  yet; get it there first. FIRST CUT DONE (2026-07-02): the legacy `Panel()` stretch-blit path is gone —
  legacy panels (live citymap chrome, button fallback) now draw through the SAME manifest `style.frames`
  (v3 tile + centerFill) the element renderer uses; `AssetRegistry.Frame` + the local stretch nine-slice
  deleted. Verified live-citymap smoke: THE CASTLE panel wears the tiled hazard frame. REMAINING for the
  floor: per-screen pixel-walks vs design PNGs to find leftover wrong box treatments (fold into the
  SYSTEMIC fidelity-diff work below).
- ~~OVERSIZED frames/borders/corner-bolts~~ **FIXED (2026-07-02):** `DrawFrameTex` now nine-slices with
  the same `dstCornerScale: 1/ChromeBake` the button path uses — every manifest frame + the legacy
  Panel route through it, so panel/card corners render at native proportion (citymap gauges/legend
  visibly slimmed to design weight). Gate green.
- ~~`e` doesn't exit Equipment~~ **FIXED (2026-07-02):** E toggles — the key that opens Equipment now
  closes it (alongside Esc), returning to the caller.
- ~~WATCH — Windows DPI scaling~~ **CLOSED (2026-07-02, no code change):** the game's `app.manifest`
  already declares per-monitor-v2 DPI awareness (MonoGame template), so fullscreen gets TRUE native
  pixels (2560×1600 confirmed via Win32_VideoController). Doug's 1707×1067 reading came from his
  PowerShell probe, which is itself a DPI-UNAWARE process seeing the 150%-scaled desktop — the probe
  lies, the game doesn't. If fullscreen still looks soft on a FRESH build, reopen with a screenshot.

**‼ SYSTEMIC — build UI VALIDATION / proof-of-correctness (the ROOT CAUSE of "starved before pixel-perfect"):**
the loop has NO deterministic way to know how well a screen matches its design PNG — so it can't measure
the remaining gap, can't justify "done" or "starved," and regressions slip (combat 95%-blank; the font
bug). The manifest gives correct LAYOUT/DATA, NOT visual correctness (not a silver bullet for a visual
game). Build, in order:
- **Coverage + content validation (deterministic, headless, ALL 5 screens every pass):** assert EVERY
  manifest element renders NON-BLANK at its expected rect, and each BOUND element shows LIVE data (not its
  `sample`). This alone catches the combat regression + empty/overlapping labels the instant they happen.
  BIND-RESOLUTION REPORT DONE (2026-07-02): `RB_MF=all` also reports per screen which BOUND elements
  resolve LIVE data (`SMOKE BINDS: resolved=M/N unresolved=[...]`); drive a run first
  (`RB_SCREEN=encounter RB_MF=all`) to validate the in-run screens (encounter resolves 14/21 driven vs
  4/21 cold; the residue = container binds + state-gated ones). `encounter.label` now resolves to the
  live node type (place names stay design-open); `pool.legend`'s sample IS the design copy (its pips
  are Needs-CD, no live datum exists). First catch: the encounter smoke drive had silently rotted
  (cleared-fight-HOLDS made post-Resolve Enter() hops no-op — the "castle" shot was really the a1
  hold); each hop redeploys now. A bind that silently goes dead shows the pass it happens.
  NOT yet an exit-gate (pin a baseline first).
  PER-ELEMENT COVERAGE DONE (2026-07-02): `RB_MF=all` now leave-one-out renders EVERY element and
  measures its actual pixel contribution — an element with unconditional chrome/content (fill/frame/
  content/image/button) contributing ZERO pixels fails the run (exit 1); bind-only/list elements empty
  pre-run report SILENT (state-gated, ok); border-only elements overpainted by the mixed-z container
  fills report OCCLUDED (encounter/attrPool's divider — Needs-CD z normalization). First catch: citymap
  `doomHost` (a bindless text element whose static `image` was never blitted) — fixed, the enemy-host
  icon renders. REMAINING: bound-shows-LIVE-not-sample assertions (needs driven run state in the smoke)
  + the fidelity diff below.
- **Fidelity diff vs `design/NN.png`:** a region/perceptual image compare → an objective match score +
  per-region delta map (meaningful once fonts/chrome land; tolerate known placeholder-data regions).
  BUILT (2026-07-02): `tools/fidelity_diff.py <shot> <design> [--map heat.png] [--worst N]` — 24×14
  tile grid in design space, per-tile color+edge distance → overall % + the worst tiles as design-space
  rects (+ optional heatmap). BASELINES (RB_MF pre-run shots, so placeholder-data regions depress the
  numbers): encounter 71.1 / equipment 66.9 / citymap 74.2 / campaignmap 85.1 / newgame 66.4 /
  merchant 76.7. REFINEMENTS open: drive run state for live-data shots; a placeholder-region mask.
  WORST-TILE WALKS (2026-07-02, the enumerated-delta discipline): NEWGAME's 0% tiles = the known
  Needs-CD extraction gaps (card bg/chrome parts, boxed stat tiles, SELECT buttons, race head art);
  EQUIPMENT's = missing screen backdrop art (design/02 shows one; the manifest has no scene element
  — Needs-CD), textured `ui/pip/*` attr-bar pips (Needs-CD, already logged), runeCard chrome
  (Needs-CD). Both screens' remaining fidelity floors are CD-gated; no renderer-side deltas found.
  ENCOUNTER walked (2026-07-02 pm): 0% tiles = poolRow pip strips (Needs-CD, known), action-bar CARD
  chrome/frames + footer state lines (Needs-CD techCard parts), hero/minion/foe figure art +
  positions (placeholder art), under-figure name+segmented-HP bars (heroHp/foeHp resolve text; the
  segments need pip parts — Needs-CD). MERCHANT walked: its low tiles are a STATE artifact (the
  gate's drive ends at the castle so merchant lists are legitimately empty) + the same chrome family;
  a true merchant walk needs a merchant-state drive — DONE (2026-07-02 pm): the gate now runs TWO
  driven passes (encounter drive owns encounter/equipment/campaignmap/newgame; the citymap drive
  stops AT THE MERCHANT and owns citymap/merchant), so merchant validates with live stock: binds
  10/17 (residue = containers + the single-page pager's legit-null prev/next). All walked screens'
  floors are CD/art/design-gated — zero renderer-side deltas remain from the walks.
- **GATES — PINNED (2026-07-02):** `python tools/ui_gate.py` = the ONE regression command: scratch
  build → driven all-screen smoke (blank-screen + blank-element failures are the engine's own exit
  code) → per-screen bind-resolution counts vs `tools/ui_baseline.json` (a DROP = a bind went dead =
  fail) → per-screen fidelity score vs baseline (drop past 2pts = fail). `--update` re-pins after a
  slice that legitimately improves things — run the gate EVERY pass before commit. Baselines (driven):
  binds enc 15/21 eq 11/26 city 2/7 camp 4/4 ng 12/18 mer 5/17; fidelity 66.9/65.8/69.4/84.1/65.8/76.4.
- **GATES (design bar):** a screen is "DONE" only when coverage+content pass AND the fidelity diff is under threshold.
  The loop may claim "blocked/starved" ONLY by emitting the ENUMERATED per-element remaining-delta list,
  each tagged **CD / system / human** with a reason. No backed-up list ⇒ NOT starved — keep perfecting
  what's achievable. **Missing systems/content must NOT block pixel-perfecting the elements that DO exist.**

**⚡ NOT STARVED — DROP-INDEPENDENT WORK (do NOW; the pixel-perfect render POLISH is drop-gated on CD's
states/sides/colorBind/merchant manifest, but plenty needs NO drop):**
- Finish the flagged CODE fixes below (war-party fill R→L; Bandage target-side {enemy|self} + shield
  sources flagged PASSIVE + the SHIELD-BAR wiring; the Encounter/CampaignMap Equipment buttons shell-side
  if doable; the `apex`→`Core Effect` CODE rename `ApexName/Desc`→`CoreEffectName/Desc`).
- Build the ENGINE DRAW routines against the SCHEMA (data arrives with the drop; code is testable now):
  `states` resolution (draw by the bound datum's state key), `border.sides` (per-side borders — else a
  single accent edge draws as a FULL box), **`colorBind` [APPROVED]** (bind a color field e.g.
  `core.accent` → a visual prop), shield-pip instancing + regen fill, the merchant-screen consumer,
  **nested-list stamping** (#23 — a template/list whose items contain their OWN list: merchant shelves,
  runeGroup rows) + **merchant paging** (#23; same family as #4 overflow).
- **CONTINGENCY GREEN-LIT** (render polish is drop-gated = the exhaustion trigger is met): the **`Game1.cs`
  SRP refactor** — split the uber-class by responsibility. High-value, fully drop-independent.
- **If after all this everything left is TRULY blocked (needs a drop / a human decision): STOP looping**
  — say so in one line; do NOT spin, invent busywork, or grind low-value churn (see loop.md).

FLAGGED FIXES (from live screenshots):
- ~~Enter still passes the OLD build screen~~ DONE (2026-07-02): BEGIN now marches straight to the
  CityMap (`Redeploy` + Run screen) — no build gate; the fixed kit keeps the bar non-empty.
- ~~Equipment must be the FULL screen, not the LOADOUT popover~~ MOSTLY DONE (2026-07-02): popover
  DELETED; E / the EQUIPMENT button opens the real Equipment screen; Esc returns to the caller. In a
  run the screen reads the LIVE state (run body/reservations, run bar, run minions) and card clicks
  power/unpower on the campaign; pre-run they slot/unslot the build; rune Climb stays pre-run (mid-run
  rune mutation is design-open). RESIDUAL: an Encounter button (disabled in combat) + a CampaignMap
  button need manifest elements (Needs-CD); a drawn BACK affordance likewise (Esc carries it).
- (drop renamed `combat.flee`→`combat.retreat` — resolver + input geometry flipped same pass)
- **AUTO-ATTACK button isn't wired** — believed ALREADY WIRED at the Encounter cut-over (slice 14:
  the combat.autoAttack element click toggles the one global AUTO, and its label reads
  "AUTO-ATTACK ON" when lit). If the screenshot predates that build, re-test; else report repro.
- ~~Resource-count readout top-right~~ DONE (2026-07-02) for supplies / gold / charge (the drop's new
  charge icon renders) on Encounter + CityMap + Equipment, InRun-gated. SUMMONS joins when its §9
  resource model lands (not yet built).
- ~~War-party indicator (fill direction re-open)~~ DONE (2026-07-02): the covered-ground fill now loads
  RIGHT→LEFT IN TANDEM with the host — its leading (left) edge tracks the host token; camp LEFT / castle
  RIGHT unchanged (citymap smoke green).
- ~~Targeting reticles don't sit on the foe's body parts~~ ENGINE DONE (2026-07-02): reticles anchor
  on the figure's ACTUAL limb rects via the manifest transform (`FigureBinding.StatOf` + a screen-rect
  union, both arms as one group) — AIMING centres on the hovered part while picking, FOCUS marks each
  locked part-aim (verified on the aimed head). Band strips remain the click hit-test. REMAINING
  Needs-CD: the demonstrative "how-it-mounts" design screens to pixel-match against.
- ~~SHIELD BAR + active-shield BUG~~ DONE (2026-07-02): passivity landed earlier (IsPassive, CardPress
  toggles); the drop's bar is WIRED — variable-N pips (one per layer, filled-first), live/spent state
  styles, and the per-pip regen track (Core-tested 304). Dashed spent-borders solid pending pixel pass.
- ~~CityMap start node = CAMP~~ DONE (2026-07-02): `NodeType.Camp` end-to-end — the origin authors as
  Camp, fog always shows it (your own origin), re-entering it spawns NO fight (safe ground, like the
  merchant), and the chart blits the camp token. Core-tested (297 green).
- ~~Friendly/self vs enemy TARGET-SIDE bug~~ DONE (2026-07-02): `Technique.Side` {Enemy|Self} added
  (Bandage declares Self — its heal already auto-picks the caster's most-damaged part at discharge);
  `IsPassive` derives from ShieldLayers>0 so a source can't be authored active. CardPress now: a powered
  SELF tech never enters targeting; a powered PASSIVE source toggles OFF (§6b) — never the FSM.
  Core-tested (296 green). The SHIELD BAR UI waits on CD's bar design.

RENAME **apex → Core Effect** — COMPLETE (2026-07-02): code side done earlier; today's CD drop renamed
the manifest binds (`preview.coreEffect*` / `core.coreEffect*`, zero `apex` left in layout.json) and the
Game resolver keys flipped in the same pass (keystone "apex-tier" untouched). [DESIGN_SPEC §17 #14]

MINION RESOURCE = **Summons** [LOCKED §9/§14] — BUILT (2026-07-02): Caster carries MaxSummons/
SummonsLeft (Forge sizes runs at bays+2, placeholder; bare test casters stay unlimited); a FRESH summon
spends 1 (uniform across gates) + its gate; a drained gate stat now IDLES the minion (stays summoned,
silent, holds its bay) and it re-raises FREE on recovery — the old drain-dismiss cascade + its test are
superseded. Merchant stocks summons (seeded x1-2, M key) + the in-run readout shows summons N/M (icon
landed 07-02). Core-tested (300 green). REMAINING: minion DEATH (no HP model yet — killed
re-pay untestable) + the Summoner Core Effect refund (next).

MERCHANT: mechanics SPEC'd (§12). PARTIAL (2026-07-02): resource stock (seeded per node — supplies 1-3,
charge 1-2, capped top-ups, placeholder prices flagged to the economy tune) + the 1-HP buy + the premium
FULL-heal are BUILT + Core-tested (298 green) + wired into the stopgap popover (H/F/S/C). REMAINING:
Summons stock (needs the §9 resource model). The 5-CATEGORY gear stock MODEL is BUILT (2026-07-02):
`MerchantStock.Roll` — seeded/reproducible, ≤4 of 5 sections, 3 picks per section (pool-capped),
techniques always-5-when-present + 2nd-rarest, rank-2 runes rarer, keystones NEVER; section weights
placeholder (shuffle algorithm OPEN §17). Shape Core-tested over a 400-seed sweep (300 green).
WIRED (2026-07-02): Expedition rolls the stock ONCE per merchant node from its seed (GearSalt) —
weapons/armor buy from the roll (purchases consume it; the static Shops lists are retired from the
merchant path), and techniques/minions/runes are OFFERED (exposed lists) but not yet buyable — their
receiving models (mid-run palette/bay/rune mutation) stay the design-open gate. The standard map's
"b" merchant deterministically stocks dagger+plate so the existing buy/equip tests hold unchanged. The SCREEN LAYOUT waits on a CD design PNG (popover = flagged stopgap).

**AFTER HiFi completes/blocks + all outstanding identified bugs resolved:**
- ~~Summoner CoreRune — real Core Effect~~ BUILT (2026-07-02): `CoreRune.CoreEffectRefundsSummons`
  (effect-as-DATA, one interpreter) threads Forge→Campaign→Expedition; Redeploy refunds 1 Summons per
  SURVIVING minion (idle counts — still summoned), capped at max; Summoner's card copy updated to the
  real effect (CD reconciles the design/05 Legion label). Core-tested over a live cleared fight
  (301 green). NOTE surfaced: the Shade (INT 3) fails its gate at assembly on a base Human (INT 3,
  Skeleton already reserving 2) — only the Skeleton fields from the off; balance touchpoint.
- **CONTINGENCY (HiFi is CD-blocked → active):** refactor the uber `Game1.cs` — split by responsibility
  (SRP), codify SOLID where it sensibly applies. STARTED (2026-07-02): the manifest RENDERER half
  (generic element renderer, list/graph stamping, bind resolvers, fidelity primitives — 640 lines)
  lives in `Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`; the legacy CityMap screen (chart/panels/gear bar/merchant
  stopgap/spine — 289 lines, retires wholesale at the citymap cut-over) lives in `Game1.CityMap.cs`.
  The palette + raw draw primitives (rect/border/line/sprite/glyph-safe text/panel/bar/button — 205
  lines, no game knowledge) live in `Game1.Canvas.cs`. Partial splits, behavior identical; Game1.cs
  1867→780 (loop/input/state + encounter shell). Splits are DONE for now — true class extraction
  (canvas as a real type) only if a concrete need shows; don't refactor for its own sake.

## ⇒ HOW TO WORK THIS ARC — read EVERY pass (pixel-perfect · no drift · no premature "done")
ONE screen per pass. The goal is: every screen renders 100% from `layout.json` and matches its
`design/NN-*.png` **pixel-close**.

1. **Render FROM the manifest, never hand-draw.** Draw via the shared renderer (`DrawManifestScreen` /
   `DrawManifestElement`). If a screen needs something the renderer can't do yet, **extend the SHARED
   renderer** (one path for all screens) — never special-case a screen or fall back to hardcoded rects/
   frames. Hardcoded layout is how the old drift happened.
2. **Verify by COMPARISON, every time.** Build to a scratch dir, `RB_MF=<screen>` to render it, then open
   BOTH the shot AND `design/<screen>.png` and walk it element-by-element, listing every delta (position,
   size, colour token, text, font size, chrome/shadow/frame, missing/extra elements, stray borders). Fix
   until the delta list is EMPTY. "Looks like something" is not the bar — matching the reference is.
3. **Drive the STATE, don't trust the picture.** For data-driven screens, drive input→state (pick race/
   core, equip, aim a foe part, redeploy) and confirm LIVE data renders — binds resolve to real values,
   not the template `sample`. A control that looks right but does nothing is not done.
4. **NO DRIFT — manifest + design PNG are the ONLY source of truth.** Don't invent layout, don't add
   borders/boxes/padding not in the design, don't "improve" it. If the manifest looks wrong, FLAG it
   (Needs-CD/human) — never diverge by hand to "fix" it (that re-introduces drift).
5. **"DONE" means ALL of:** renders 100% from the manifest (zero hardcoded layout for that screen);
   delta-list vs the design PNG is EMPTY (you actually read both images); live state drives it; build
   GREEN; `crash.log` clean. Less than that is NOT done — write the exact residual as a checklist line,
   don't check the screen off.
6. **Blocked?** Write the SPECIFIC missing capability (what the design needs that the manifest/renderer
   can't express) as a concrete Needs-CD/human item. NEVER claim "exhausted" or silently approximate.
7. One screen per commit; small semantic slice; pull-before / push-after; update this file (check a screen
   only if truly done per #5, else note residual). Then STOP.

## Current target — the manifest-driven screen RENDERER (close the design delta)
The shared render path is the ONE path: `DrawManifestScreen`/`DrawManifestElement` + `ManifestUi` /
`CardTemplate` / `ListLayout` / `GraphLayout` / `StageComposer` / `NineSlice`.

FOUNDATION DONE (slices 1-7 — see git): Element `Shadow`/`Frame`/`Fill`/`Border` model + generic element
renderer (§10 order: shadow → frame|fill → border → content); LIST rendering (item template stamped per
cell, grid flow); LIVE bind resolver (`race.*`/`core.*` → live data, else `sample`); per-attr tiles;
`fontPx` scaling; display data (`Race.Tag/Blurb`, `CoreRune.ApexName/Desc` — DISPLAY-ONLY, no apex EFFECTS).

SLICES (one screen/pass, pixel-verify vs its design PNG):
1. **NewGame** — CUT OVER: the live screen now renders via `DrawManifestScreen("newgame")`; the old
   5-card + `RACE [tab]` screen is DELETED. Input reads manifest geometry BY BINDS (races/cores list
   cells + begin rect — never CD's renameable element ids). `.selection` parts draw only on the chosen
   card (CHOSEN / CORE SET follow clicks; other state binds still gated). Verified LIVE + state-driven:
   RB_CHASSIS=2 moves CORE SET to Adept and the whole preview column follows (figure/role/budget/apex).
   Renderer foundation from this arc: z back-to-front, fill+frame, text-shadow-as-glyph-copy,
   height-capped word-wrap, template-part fill/border.
   NOT design-done — remaining deltas are ALL manifest-expressiveness gaps (Needs-CD below): card/tile
   bg+chrome parts, tile value+label split, `align`, button/chip labels+fills, core-rune icons +
   ①②③/✚ glyph font, head-image assets, hi-fi bg. Re-walk the full delta list when CD's drop lands.
   Race-column pixel-walk (2026-07-01, live vs design/05): positions/values MATCH the manifest; the
   residual deltas are (a) text ~1.5x wider than the mock — the SYSTEM display font is wider than the
   design font at the same fontPx (fixed by the bundled-font swap, tracked in Verify mechanics), and
   (b) the known Needs-CD chrome: no card bg/panel part, no whole-card CHOSEN ring (only the chip is
   in the template), race.headImage draws its gradient slot but head sprites don't exist, ✓ folds.
   No renderer-side bugs found in the walk.
2. **Equipment** — CUT OVER: live screen renders via `DrawManifestScreen("equipment")`; the hand-drawn
   build screen (core selector/core block/palette/loadout strip/anatomy tags) is DELETED. Core switching
   is REMOVED from this screen per design/02 (core is fixed between fights — that choice is NewGame's).
   Input by binds: tab strip picks GEAR/TECHNIQUES/MINIONS (`_invTab`, render-side state); TECHNIQUES
   tab lists the palette as inv cards (badge stat+reserve, name) — click slots/unslots; clicking a
   slotted action-bar card unslots; keys 1-9 still toggle; Enter marches (the design's READY TO MARCH
   chip was flattened into the status strip by extraction — Needs-CD; Enter carries the march).
   Live binds: paperDoll figure, attr bars (§6 part labels, free/cap, positional pips), loadout/minion
   cards, core identity, rune budget. BIND-RENAME RECONCILED (2026-07-02): the CD drop renamed the
   inventory binds (`invItems`→`inventory.activeTab.items`, `tabs`→`inventory.tabs`) and neither render
   nor input was chased — the GEAR tab had been stamping "Sword" SAMPLES instead of live gear and tab
   clicks were dead (the bind validator surfaced it). Chased clean; PLUS the drop's new equipment binds
   mapped live: `core.name`, `run.state` (real expedition state in-run), `loadout.slotLabel` /
   `minions.slotLabel`, `core.stats` identity rows (bays/actions/budget), `runes.budgetPct` (spent-
   fraction bar; datum-driven fills are exempt from the blank-element gate at zero). Equipment binds
   21/26 driven — the 5 left are pure containers. NOTE minor CD collision: coreLabel/marchState overlap
   the resourceStrip top-right. RUNE BAG LIVE: one group per PATH ladder (MARKS/PATHS/KEYSTONES
   taxonomy stays OPEN §17 — the model's ladders render); each group shows held-rung + next with
   `Mark.Name` display titles (Vessel Seal I/II, Hollow Vessel, ...), a data-derived effect line
   (sockets/grants — can't drift), live EQUIPPED/EQUIPPABLE/LOCKED state + discounted cost; clicking a
   group card Climbs the ladder (budget-gated in Core). Group header label + row icon/stack are
   bindless in the template (Needs-CD). GEAR tab now lists the RUN's gear (wielded + packed weapons,
   armor; EMPTY pre-run — gear only exists once marching); rarity chip stays gated (no rarity model).
   Not design-done: chrome/label gaps in Needs-CD.
3. **Encounter** — CUT OVER: the fighting screen renders `DrawManifestScreen("encounter")` over the
   battlefield backdrop; only the cleared/lost overlay stays legacy (not part of design/01). Combat
   input reads manifest geometry by binds: card cells press/right-press, the foe hit-box + limb bands
   ARE the foeFigure element, AUTO-ATTACK/FLEE/HELD chips click (labels authored in the shell — the
   design chips were flattened by extraction, Needs-CD). Fielded minions draw as sprites in the
   minionField element. Deleted: DrawFighter/AttributePool/Pips/Foe/Bays/Support/ActionBar + hot/
   toggle buttons + hand rects (~10 helpers). LOST at cut-over (manifest lacks the element — Needs-CD/
   design): per-card AIM TAG (F1:H read), banked/rallied SUPPORT pips (rally lane already in Debt).
   Live binds (all verified over a live castle fight): hero/foe figures + HP, pool rows w/ live
   reservations, technique/bay cards (stat glyph tiles, costs), FSM state chips (DRY/HELD/READY/
   COOLDOWN, idle = no chip), cooldown labels, charge-progress fill widths, bay ACTIVE.
   AIMING state done: the card the targeting FSM is picking for reads an AIMING chip + "locking on"
   label (design/01's Firebolt card), verified live via the encounter smoke's targeting card.
   Gaps: techCard's bindless sample parts (the cost NUMBER + the mid-description damage digit) stamp
   their sample on every card (Needs-CD: bind them).
   Pixel-walk vs the NEW hi-res design/01 (2026-07-02): positions/values match the manifest; deltas are
   the known chrome family PLUS two fresh Needs-CD items — `poolRow` has NO pip parts (the design's
   per-stat pip strips can't render; `ui/pip/*` assets exist), and the re-dropped manifest LOST the
   "Attribute Pool"/"Action Bar" panel titles that design/01 shows (they were elements before the
   re-drop). No renderer-side bugs found. Equipment walked vs the new design/02 too (2026-07-02):
   clean — same known gaps; one family addition: attrBar pips are FLAT FILL parts where the design
   shows the textured `ui/pip/*` states (hatch/reserved) — pips-as-imageBind would close both screens.
   DISPLAY COPY DONE: `Technique.Desc`/`Minion.Desc` (+`DescText`) ship card copy for all 8 techniques
   + both minions; `{power}` resolves from the data at render so copy can't contradict tuning. Bound
   via technique.description/bay.description; Core-tested (290 green).
4. **CityMap** (in progress) — `design/03`. The manifest `chart` graph element renders LIVE
   via `DrawManifestGraph` (GraphLayout spread over the element region): fog-aware beacon icons,
   charted solid / uncharted dashed links, the current node ringed "you are here", reachable
   deployments numbered. Verified RB_MF=citymap at a live merchant node. PANELS LIVE (2026-07-02):
   all 7 citymap binds resolve — SUPPLIES/MUSTERED SUPPORT gauges read live counts + flavor (bound
   PANELS now draw their resolved header inset over the chrome — same path lights encounter's SHIELD
   header), the war-party bar fills covered-ground RIGHT→LEFT live (`enemy.advancePct`; full-rect fill
   bypassed — the width IS the datum), the chart legend list stamps its 4 icon+label rows through
   NodeToken. Inner pip STRIPS stay flattened-extraction Needs-CD. FRESH Needs-CD: `doomEta` is a
   BINDLESS content literal ("1 WAYPOINT AWAY FROM CAMP" mock) — bind it (enemy.advance) and drop the
   bind from the doomBar container, else the mock shows beside the live count; legend rows overlap
   their panel's top edge (item pad).
   **VISUAL CUT-OVER DONE (2026-07-02):** the LIVE citymap renders `DrawManifestScreen("citymap")` —
   legacy chart/supply-panels/war-party/legend/gold-readout DELETED; node input reads the MANIFEST
   chart geometry (NodeRect locates the chart by its `map` bind, so clicks land exactly where the
   graph draws; legacy region is only a no-manifest fallback). STILL HAND-DRAWN, flagged un-homed
   overlays (design/03 shows none of them — Needs-CD/human home before they can die): gear bar +
   PACK chips, EQUIPMENT [E] button, castle panel, campaign spine (parked bottom-left). Known
   overlaps: node[3] label under the castle panel, legend rows over their panel edge (both CD-side).
   Verified live smoke + gate green.
   REMAINING for cut-over: map input on manifest geometry (node clicks); a home for the merchant panel,
   gear bar + EQUIPMENT button (design/03 shows none of them — surface where they live, Needs-CD/human,
   before deleting the legacy citymap screen).
5. **CampaignMap** (render started) — `design/04`. The manifest screen renders: header/eyebrow,
   `campaign.taken` ("N / M" from the live campaign), and `cityGraph` draws one marker per campaign
   LEG spread across the region (taken = solid good links, current framed, onward dotted) with
   "Tier N - TAKEN/CURRENT" labels. City NAMES stay undrawn — §12/§17 leave the city roster OPEN
   (count, procgen-vs-authored), so no names are invented; the design's castle icons are absent from
   the cityNode template (Needs-CD). MODEL gap: §12 Layer 1 locks a forward-biased city GRAPH but
   Campaign is still a linear leg list — graph model + campaign-level supplies/WAIT is its own Core
   pass (surface before building). No screen-flow entry yet (not reachable in game; RB_MF only).
FLOW [FIX — still wrong today]: (1) BUG — Enter still passes through the OLD build screen; NewGame must go
STRAIGHT to CityMap, no build gate / no Enter-through. (2) Equipment must open as a **FULL SCREEN**
(design/02) — KILL the redundant "LOADOUT" popover; route ALL access to the real screen. (3) Hotkey **`e`**
(was `i`) + an "open Equipment" BUTTON on Encounter (DISABLED in combat), CityMap, CampaignMap; a
**BACK/close** on Equipment returns to the CALLER (CityMap already shows EQUIPMENT [E]; add Encounter +
CampaignMap). (4) MERCHANT is an IMPROVISED un-designed POPOVER stopgap — the heal+gear-shop MECHANIC is
designed (§12/§14), the SCREEN is not; spec with Doug + a CD design PNG before building it (design-open,
DESIGN_SPEC §17). Do NOT expand the popover as if it were the design. See DESIGN_SPEC §12.
(core.icon bind + mgcb icon entries: DONE 2026-07-02. FONT task: DONE 2026-07-02 — see the P0 block.)

ENGINE TODOs reconciled from CD's gap list (2026-07-01) — NOT already covered above:
- **`imageBind`** — DONE (2026-07-02, CD #15): `TemplatePart.ImageBind` parses (contract-tested), the
  list renderer resolves `{bind}` placeholders per datum generically, and the map graph blits the
  fog-aware node token through it — skirmish ⚔ renders live; the "unknown ?" stopgap mapping retired.
- **Button 9-slice corners** — DONE (2026-07-02, CD #11): DrawButton nine-slices the 320×88 skins
  (was stretch-scaled); source margins 12px, destination corners land at 12 TARGET px via NineSlice's
  new `dstCornerScale` (1/SS for 2x art) so rivets stay native and a 25px-tall button keeps its face
  (Core-tested). If CD meant 12 DESIGN px corners instead, flip the scale to 1 — one constant.
- **Container overflow/scroll** (CD #4): DEFERRED (2 races / 6 cores fit today) — add a scroll/page
  primitive when a list actually overflows; tracked here so it's not lost.
- **Confirm-to-close (lets Doug clear CD's entries):** on the relevant cutovers, confirm `cityNode` reads
  `[8,8]` (CampaignMap, CD #12) and the 5 full-bleed HUD bars ship WITHOUT a `frame` (CD #14 regression fix).
- NOTE: CD #1+7 (shadow/frame/gradient DRAW) is STALE — the foundation renderer already draws them (§10
  order). Frame-v3 tile/repeat + centerFill (CD #16) — DONE 2026-07-02 (NineSlice tiles edge/centre
  patches at native scale, trailing chunk crops 1:1; centerFill:false leaves the middle open;
  Core-tested). Only a gradient-interpolation check remains; CD can close #1+7's basic-draw.

## Verify mechanics
- `RB_MF=<screenId>` renders a screen STRAIGHT from the manifest (safe — live screens untouched): the
  cut-over dev hook. `RB_SMOKE=1 RB_SHOT=x.png RB_SCREEN=<newgame|equipment|encounter|citymap> dotnet …`
  renders a LIVE screen to a PNG headless.
- A RUNNING game locks the default build output → build to a SCRATCH dir and run THAT instance.
- On ANY crash READ `bin/Debug/net9.0/crash.log` (Program.cs writes the full exception + stack).
- Fonts are BUNDLED TTFs (IM Fell English display / JetBrains Mono mono; regions incl. ①②③ ✓ ✚ ◉,
  DefaultCharacter "?"). `Core.GlyphSafe.Sanitize` still guards anything outside the regions.
- FIDELITY: `python tools/fidelity_diff.py <shot> design/NN-*.png --map heat.png` scores a shot vs its
  design (see the SYSTEMIC block for baselines). Run after RB_MF=all; walk the worst tiles it lists.
  **GATE on it — a screen is NOT done until its score is under threshold; run every pass, all 5 screens.**
  ~~dead-baseline warning~~ RESOLVED 2026-07-03: baselines re-pinned on fidelity v2 (1:1 @ 1920×1080,
  per-element ranked lists, newgame stat mask) — see P0-A.3.
  RE Doug's ~2×-oversize note — TRIAGED (2026-07-02 pm): (1) BORDERS were genuinely 2× — `BorderPx`
  had pinned the old fixed-SS=2 weight (w=1 → 2 design px); now draws the AUTHORED design px. FIXED.
  (2) Run-together gauge text FIXED — the wrap is '\n'-aware and the gauge resolvers stack
  "SUPPLIES n/m" over its caption line. (3) **"wrong font" = a STALE RUNNING BUILD**: the game
  instance that's been holding the exe lock all evening predates the font swap AND every P0 fix —
  RESTART THE GAME to see IM Fell/JetBrains, native-res, slim corners, hairline borders. (4) Supplies
  PIPS: the manifest supplies/support panels carry NO pip parts (flattened extraction — Needs-CD,
  logged); the engine renders values+captions live meanwhile. No design-px/SS element-scale confusion
  found beyond (1) — element rects come straight from manifest design px through the scene transform.

## Debt (active — with reconcile trigger)
- Equipment: no inventory tabs (GEAR/TECH/MINIONS) + drag-to-equip + equipped-gear-on-anatomy + real
  rune-bag cards yet — blocked on gear/minion equip + mid-run gear/rune mutation (design-open). MODEL now
  refined (DESIGN_SPEC §7): a Core rune gives STARTING gear (does NOT lock it), gear is swappable;
  MULTI-SLOT pieces (robe = all slots); figures MORPH (human base + race + core + equipped-gear parts) —
  author morph layers, not per-combo art. Exact morph/slot mechanics OPEN (§17); feeds this when built.
- Bow.png not mounted on the figure. (~~`shot` icon~~ RESOLVED by the 07-03 late drop —
  `icons/technique/shot.png` ships + is mirrored; drop the swing fallback when touching that code.)
- The FLAT thumbnail dir `sprites/char/chassis/*` + its `Content.mgcb` entries still use the old name.
  (The `layout.json` FIGURE keys are ALREADY `human_`/`elf_`, and CD has ALREADY renamed the screen ids
  to newgame/equipment/citymap/campaignmap/encounter — both done.) Retire the flat `chassis/` dir once
  cards compose from modular parts (the retire-bare directive).
- Gradient fill draws vertical/horizontal only; diagonal deferred (PointClamp sampler).
- Minion `AltCost` summon is an UN-COSTED placeholder — wire the real HP/stat spend when an alt-cost minion ships.
- Shields (Stoneskin) wired + available but not yet in starting kits; SpellWard deferred (no spell model).
- No rallied-support lane in combat yet. Mouse is click+hover only (no drag-to-equip/tooltips/rebinding).
- G1: skirmish foe-part-aim numbers placeholder — tune in play (campaign verified winnable).
- Targeting-FSM bug (no clean repro yet): firing after a weapon charges while UNTARGETED misbehaves —
  watch/fix as the targeting+firing FSM is refined. **Investigated (2026-07-04 loop, 350 tests):** traced
  `Caster.Step`/`Discharge` for the requireAim path — a Timered technique reaching `Countdown<=0` while
  unaimed correctly HOLDS at zero (no decrement below it, no phantom fire), and the first `Step` after
  `Aim()` discharges exactly once with a clean cooldown reset. New
  `PlayerDoctrineChargesToReadyWhileUntargetedThenFiresCleanlyOnceAimed` (`CasterFiringTests.cs`) pins this.
  No bug found in Core's FSM logic for this path — if the misbehavior is real, it's likely in the
  `Game1.cs`/`CombatTargeting` render-shell layer (card-state chip reading, or a stale `Targeting` cursor),
  not the discharge model itself. Still needs a live repro to pin down further.
- Code ORGANIZATION (LOW-PRI — do NOT prioritize over HiFi): the `Game1.cs` uber-class was split (good),
  but the resulting classes lack a sensible FOLDER structure — organize into responsibility-based dirs
  (e.g. `Roguebane.Game/{Rendering,Screens,Input,Assets,...}`, `Roguebane.Core` by domain). Pure housekeeping;
  reconcile whenever render/HiFi work isn't the priority.
- FTL-ism **"jump"** (the beacon-chart verb) — canonical terms are **deployment** (the move/unit) +
  **Redeploy** (the action), **Retreat** (bail a fight). STOP THE BLEEDING: introduce NO new "jump" in any
  text/identifier. UI strings + the two canon docs are fixed; residual "jump" lives only in CODE COMMENTS
  + test prose — LOW-PRIORITY sweep, DEFERRED until the hi-fi render arc is confirmed complete. ("beacon"
  is the other FTL-ism — embedded in the `beaconNode` manifest template + comments; flagged for a
  decision, not auto-changed. "FTL" in comments is an allowed private design ref, leave it.)

## ⇒ NEW LOCKS (2026-07-04, Doug — design session answering the 2026-07-03 Needs-human batch)
Doug resolved four open blockers + greenlit prepping a few cores to "advanced prototype" BEFORE the
first real balance playtest. All folded into DESIGN_SPEC in this pass (§6e, §6c, §9, §11, new §7a):
1. **Cascade sustain model RESOLVED → §6e:** SUMMED shared pool (not individual thresholds in
   isolation) — equipped gear + active techniques both reserve against the SAME live attribute pool;
   on shrink, active techniques disable FIRST, equipment only if the pool is still short after that.
   **UNBLOCKS the disable-cascade ranking build** (previously parked, §6/§6e Remaining).
2. **Rune bag RESOLVED → §11:** it's the ONE inventory home for every owned rune regardless of source
   (budget/merchant/loot/reward) — a bought Mark becomes its held rung immediately via the EXISTING
   ladder-group display; no new UI state. Closes the bought-rune Needs-human item.
3. **M0 textgeom RESOLVED:** switch the overflow/collision detector to INK bounding boxes (not the
   drawn box) — matches the probes, still catches clipped/missing text. Loop-queued below.
4. **Plate armor RESOLVED: RETIRE.** Delete `Shops.cs`'s legacy `Plate`/`Hide`/`Armor`/`ArmorPool`
   fixed-stock fields — `MerchantStock.Roll` + `ArmorLines` already supersede them (STATUS's old
   07-03 merchant note said as much; this just executes the retire). Clean removal, no back-compat.
5. **Minion cadence bug RESOLVED → §9:** minions were firing every COMBAT TICK (10/s), not on their
   own cadence — root cause of "Skeleton hits like every second." Minions now carry their own Timer
   like a weapon; Skeleton/Golem/Hound numbers + a Shade-retire recommendation are in §9 (Golem +
   Hound are NEW content; Shade needs Doug's confirm before the loop deletes it — flagged, not done).
6. **Starting kits + per-core THEME → new §7a:** six cores get a real weapon+armor(+minion) kit and a
   visual theme brief for CD (payload B12, `outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`) — this + the minion fix
   IS the "advanced prototype" prep Doug wants done before the balance-playtest pass.
**CORRECTION (2026-07-04, same day, Doug caught it):** the first pass under-scoped what B12 actually
needs — "reuses the existing figure-morph contract, zero new plumbing" was asserted without checking
LAYOUT_CONTRACT/ASSET_MANIFEST. TRUTH: actually wearing armor on the figure doesn't exist as a system
yet at all (only card/inventory icons do today); B2-GO is its first build, and per-core THEME is a real
new dimension on top of that. `LAYOUT_CONTRACT.md` §12a (added this pass) now specs the real
convention: a required GENERIC worn-armor layer (`sprites/gear/worn/<line>/<slot>_<tier>_<condition>`)
+ an optional THEMED override (`.../<core>/...`), with an explicit fallback chain (themed → generic
same-condition → generic healthy → bare) so partial CD coverage never breaks anything. **Scope LOCKED
(Doug, 2026-07-04): the FULL set** — all 4 tiers × all 3 conditions per core's own line (B12) —
flagged likely multi-night; ship incrementally by tier/condition, the fallback chain covers any gap
between drops.
**CORRECTION #2 same day (Doug: "what about race?"):** checked `layout.json`'s real figure rects
instead of assuming — HEAD + CHEST/TORSO are NOT race-agnostic (elf head is landscape 152×104 vs
human's near-square ~104-112², same class as the raceCard head-stretch bug; elf torso runs ~9-10%
narrower than human's at every core sampled), ARMS + LEGS ARE race-agnostic (identical rect sizes
across race, only repositioned). LAYOUT_CONTRACT §12a now has an optional race-specific path tier for
head/chest only. **Corrected count: ~384 sprites (not 288)** — 12 race-needed slot-instances (head+
chest × 6 cores) × 12 cells × 2 races = 288, plus 8 race-agnostic slot-instances (arms+legs × 6 cores,
minus Adept/Summoner who have no arm/leg robe pieces) × 12 cells = 96.
**CLARIFIED same day (Doug):** theming only ever applies to a core's OWN favored line — any other
line renders plain generic art, core is irrelevant then (fallback chain already does this; now
explicit). Corollary: B2-GO's own GENERIC layer (already sent to CD) needs the same head/chest
race-split too, flagged as an addendum in `outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md`. Also explicitly OUT OF
SCOPE: no new body-shape variation — this is a flat art layer, doesn't touch the already-distinct
per-core figure geometry.
**CORRECTION #3 (2026-07-04, Doug — CD MIS-BUILT the sent batch; convention REVISED, supersedes the two
corrections above):** CD's first build generated themed art for EVERY armor type × core × race (a full
cross-product) + a "plain" armor type — not the design. The worn-armor convention is now RACE-FIRST,
FULL-PART sprites (canonical: LAYOUT_CONTRACT §12a; CD brief: `outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md` B12;
DESIGN_SPEC §7a): `sprites/gear/worn/<race>/<slot>/{bare_<cond> | <type>_<tier>_<cond> |
<core>/<type>_<tier>_<cond>}`. Each file is a COMPLETE part sprite (bare body + armor drawn in), NOT a
runtime overlay; themed = each core's FAVORED line only (never the cross-product); `bare` (not "plain")
is the unarmored part; EVERY body part is cooked per race (drops the arms/legs-shared optimization —
future races may differ). Revised count ≈744 (bare 24 + generic 240 + themed 480, 2 races). **The LOOP
QUEUE worn-armor item below is UPDATED to this convention.**
**LOOP QUEUE from this pass (normal priority, each its own tested slice — no invention beyond §7a/§6c/
§9's numbers):**
- ~~`CoreRune.DefaultArmor` field + assemble the six §7a kits~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop, 343 tests):
  `DefaultArmor`/`ArmorKit` mirrors `DefaultWeapons`/`WeaponKit`, wired into `NewBody` via `Body.Equip`
  (mechanical equip only — worn-art system below is still unbuilt). Also landed `WeaponKind.Shield` +
  an `Armory.Shields` ladder (Con, 1 req/tier, Hands:1 — Wooden Shield → Iron Buckler → Kite Shield →
  Tower Shield) since Grunt/Warden's kits needed it; gating `brace`'s shield-source on one being
  equipped (§6b) stays a separate follow-up, not built here. Shield sprites don't exist yet — logged
  to Asset gaps, exempted in `GearCatalogTests` like the bow gap. New `StartingKitTests.cs` pins all
  six kits (weapon + armor + minion) against §7a.
- ~~Worn-armor render system, GENERIC half~~ DONE (2026-07-04 loop, 349 tests): new pure
  `WornArmorBinding.SpriteKeys(body, visualPart, race)` in `Roguebane.Core/Layout/` resolves the §12a
  race-first candidate chain — armored same-condition → armored healthy → `bare_<condition>` → bare
  healthy — for the four worn slots (head/chest/arms/legs; boots has none). 8 tests in
  `WornArmorBindingTests.cs` pin the order, the mitigation-aware condition math, and the §6e
  disabled-armor-falls-to-bare rule already proven in `FigureBindingTests`.
  **NOT wired into `Game1.cs`** — deliberately: the doc's own "per-core body-silhouette vs worn-part
  composition" question (§17 #15) is still OURS/deferred, i.e. undecided whether a resolved worn-part
  key replaces the existing per-core figure-part draw outright, is masked to its silhouette, or
  something else. Wiring the draw loop ahead of that answer would invent an undesigned mechanic
  (CLAUDE.md). **Needs human**: Doug picks the composition approach; then the draw-loop wiring +
  THEMED override (favored-line lookup, §7a) are the remaining half of this slice. My prior
  (uncommitted) `Game1.cs`/`WornArmorBinding.cs` pass, built against the line-first overlay draft
  before CORRECTION #3 landed, was reverted rather than salvaged — different sprite model entirely.
- **Minion Timer cadence [DONE 2026-07-04 loop, 349 tests]**: `Minion` gained a required `Timer` field
  (ticks between discharges, same unit as `Technique.Cooldown`). `Caster.Step()` now decrements a
  per-bay `_minionCountdown` unconditionally every Step (mirrors the existing `Run.Countdown` technique
  pattern — keeps charging while idle) and only discharges + resets to `Timer` when it hits zero AND
  the gate is live AND the front is up; Summon seeds the countdown, Dismiss clears it. Content: Skeleton
  retuned (Timer 25/Power 1, unchanged DPS), new Golem (Timer 100/Power 4/Reserve 3, replaces Shade's
  slow/strong role) and Hound (Timer 40/Power 1/Reserve 1 DEX, deliberately weakest per-reserve-point —
  DEX is utility/evasion not DPS, per §9). Shade kept defined (still the Conclave keystone Mark's
  reward, `Paths.cs`) but dropped from `Minions.All` so it no longer surfaces in merchant stock —
  **confirm retirement of the field entirely with Doug before deleting**, since it's genuinely used
  outside the starting-kit path now. Wired into content: Summoner's kit is now Skeleton+Golem (Shade
  removed), Ranger gained `Bays: 1` + a Hound (its kit was `Bays: 0` with no pet slot despite §7a's
  locked "Hound ×1" table entry — closing that gap, not inventing new design, since the pet itself was
  already locked content).
- **textgeom ink-bbox switch [DONE 2026-07-04 loop, build+349 tests]**: `Game1.Canvas.cs` gained
  `InkBoundsRaster`/`InkBox` — walks `SpriteFont.Glyphs` the way `MeasureString` advances but unions
  each glyph's `Cropping` rect (real ink) instead of the advance cell, then scales to the drawn design
  px. Every `RecordTextBox` call site (both in `TextPxWrapped`, plus the 5 in
  `Game1.ManifestRenderer.cs`) now passes an `InkBox(...)` result instead of a font-metric box.
  Wrapped text also changed HOW it records: previously one `RecordTextBox(r, r, ...)` per element (box
  == bound, so a wrapped label's overflow could never be detected — box can't exceed itself); now one
  ink box PER RENDERED LINE, at its actual drawn position. Verified via `RB_SMOKE=1 RB_MF=all`
  before/after: overflow/collide counts ROSE on every screen (e.g. equipment 10/3 -> 26/8, encounter
  7/0 -> 9/3) — root cause is the wrapped-box blind spot above, now closed; the new hits are real
  (previously-invisible) overflow/collisions, not a detector bug. **Needs human**: triage the newly-
  surfaced per-screen overflow/collide lists (`SMOKE TEXTGEOM` console output) — this slice fixed the
  ruler, not the ~16-40 layout spillovers it now reveals.
- **Retire `Shops.cs` dead field [DONE 2026-07-04 loop, 349 tests]**: confirmed zero references
  anywhere, deleted `Shops.Armor` (the "legacy fixed stock (retiring)" list) outright — clean removal,
  no alias. `Shops.Plate`/`Shops.Hide`/`Shops.ArmorPool` stay; all three are still live (tests,
  `Expedition.cs`, `Game1.cs` seeding).

## Needs human (loop skips)
- Balance/feel tuning (all placeholder-sane, tune in PLAY): tick 10/s; cooldowns + damage; DEX haste
  2%/pt cap 28%; CON→HP 1:2 +base8; evasion %; shield amounts/regen; armed-foe + castle HP/strike/cadence;
  budgets/spoils/prices; supplies vs march length; race/core stat blocks (design/05).
- Apex EFFECTS: the 5 core signature effects are DISPLAY-ONLY placeholders — design them (+ the effect
  model) in a dedicated pass; NO undesigned mechanics in code meanwhile (CLAUDE.md guardrail). Tracked
  in the space's shared-todo memory so it surfaces again next session.
- Warden's CON-substitution idea ("STR armor requires CON instead") — FLOATED ONLY (§7a), not locked;
  replace vs stack with the already-locked Unbroken Aegis Core Effect is still Doug's call.
- Part→stat friction (legs = accuracy, arms = STR) — low-pri, revisit only if it nags.
- Worn-armor DRAW wiring (§17 #15): per-core body-silhouette vs worn-part composition — does a
  resolved worn sprite (race-first, complete part per §12a CORRECTION #3) REPLACE the existing
  per-core figure-part draw outright, get masked to its silhouette, or something else? `WornArmorBinding`
  (e1c8291) resolves the sprite KEY only and is deliberately not wired into `Game1.cs` pending this call.

## Asset gaps (Needs Claude Design) — art missing/wrong, not composable from primitives
- Shield ladder (`shield_wooden`/`shield_iron`/`shield_kite`/`shield_tower`) — no sprites shipped yet
  (new 2026-07-04 §6c/§7a content); exempt in GearCatalogTests like the bow gap until CD delivers them.
- Ranger figure (`human_ranger`/`elf_ranger`) — placeholder card until it lands.
- ~~Glyph coverage~~ RESOLVED (2026-07-02): bundled fonts + widened regions ship; ✓ renders live.
  RESIDUAL WATCH: if a bundled font truly lacks a used glyph (①②③ in IM Fell is unverified — MGCB
  built green but may substitute "?"), bake that glyph as an icon; check when a screen actually
  draws one.
- Skirmish node icon — CD adding it (the ⚔ marker on b1 + a legend row, ~8px taller: an APPROVED intended
  CityMap delta, not drift). Deliver as a node ICON PNG (`icons/node/skirmish`), NOT a font glyph.
- wraith + gargoyle: ART-QUALITY completion ONLY — NOT a uniform 21-part scheme. Robe figures legitimately
  have ~12 parts (§1 omits torso/legs/boots; adept/summoner are also 12); gargoyle's `back` is contract-
  legal. The renderer composes each figure from its OWN z-list — never assume 21 (fix any consumer/test
  that hardcodes it).
- ~~HI-FI CHROME pass~~ **LANDED 2026-07-03** (v4 frames at 1:1, wareCard/techCard/race-core card
  chrome, tile parts). Engine catches up per P0-C.3.
- ~~Manifest-extraction gaps~~ **LANDED 2026-07-03** (labels, chips, tabs, identity block, backdrops —
  the 07-03 drop closed the family). Any NEW gap gets caught by `tools/drop_audit.py` at drop time.

## Pointers
- Design canon: `design/DESIGN_SPEC.md`. Capture/layout contract: `design/LAYOUT_CONTRACT.md`.
- FUTURE / open DESIGN questions (healless-compensation archetype, shield numbers + shield-wall formula,
  race/core roster + the race↔core matrix, CON-as-minion-resource, camp-defense last-stand, keystone
  taxonomy, apex-effect design) live in **DESIGN_SPEC §17 OPEN** — not lost, canonical there by design.
- Visual truth / the pixel bar: `design/NN-*.png` + `design/SCREENS.md`.
- Shipped-work history + rationale: `git log` (detailed commits) — intentionally not duplicated here.
- Pending Claude Design payload: `outputs/CLAUDE_DESIGN_issues.md` (relay when ready; CD-resolved items
  await loop-wire + Doug's confirm-to-close — tracked in the space's designer-notes memory).

## Backlog (NOT prioritized — later; do not pull ahead of the render arc)
- **String localization / i18n:** externalize all user-facing strings behind IDs; route every drawn
  string through the renderer's `content`/`binds` text path (build toward it, don't hardcode literals) so
  a locale/string-table layer slots in later at ~zero cost; fonts need target-script glyph coverage
  (today ASCII-only). NOT now — just don't architect against it.
